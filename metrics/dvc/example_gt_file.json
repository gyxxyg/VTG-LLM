garlic <time_token_28> <time_token_29> and ginger, there's about 3 of these little teaspoons in there. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> We're going to add some chopped onions, I'm using a red onion but go ahead and use white. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Then we're going to add some powders, as always if you've watched the channel I call these <time_token_33> <time_token_34> the big 4, they're equal parts of chilli, coriander, cumin and turmeric. <time_token_35> <time_token_35> If you'd like of course you can use your favourite curry powder. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> We're going to add some salt at this stage. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> Let's just flip this over. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> And again we're going to just cook this for about now, 3 or 4 minutes, turning it constantly. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Again on a kind of above medium heat. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> We've got some lovely flavours happening now. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Now what we're going to do is add some water. <time_token_46> <time_token_49> That was cold water by the way, you know we're just sort of covering it a little bit you know. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> We're going to bring this water to the boil and then we're going to simmer this with a lid on <time_token_51> <time_token_51> for about 15 minutes. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> This is the part that I hope generally works, will tenderise our meat and make it nice and soft. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> So let's take a look now. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> Get some of that steam out of there. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> This is cooking down beautifully and as you can see look at that. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> The meat's come straight off of that bone. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> It's certainly on its way now. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> A pretty essential part of doing this dish is to get your meat nice and tender. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> You're going to end up with some awful, awful tough meat. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> No matter what cut you use. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> I mean if you bought really expensive lamb it would still end up being tough if you don't go through this process. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> I'm now going to add some potatoes which I've peeled and chopped. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> These are fairly small. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> You cut them however you like and the cooking process will obviously take a longer time if you put them in much bigger. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> So again let's give this a mix. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> Stir them in. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> We've still got a decent amount of moisture in there from that water. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> If you haven't at this point maybe it's got really dry. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Add a bit more water now. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> It's going to go back on. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> We're going to cook this for about seven to eight minutes on a fairly low heat. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Not a simmer, above a simmer. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Let's jump in now and take a look. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> That's looking more like it. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> The potatoes are cooking very nicely. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> I kind of like my potatoes quite soft. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Now at this stage I'm going to add some chopped tomatoes. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> I'm just going to spread them on the top. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> Pop the lid back on. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> On a fairly low heat we're going to cook them just for about five minutes. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> What they should do is break down with the steam. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Don't stir them at the moment. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> The steam will break them down. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> We're going to mix it around once we come back. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> We may add a little tad more water perhaps and then we're pretty much done. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> We should be now at the final stage. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Let's take a look. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> These are softening really nicely as you can see. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> They've given off a little bit of moisture as well. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Let's now turn this over. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> At this stage I'm going to add some fresh chilli. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> It's totally optional as to how much you put in. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> I've put in about four or five there. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> You now need to check this for salt. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> It's all good for me. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> You can if you want finish that off with some fresh coriander or cilantro. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> Let's just cook that for about two more minutes and it's done. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> I'm really happy with it. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> I'll see you again soon.

You'll need 1 tablespoon of melted butter, <time_token_10> <time_token_13> 2 tablespoons of beaten egg, 120ml of lukewarm water, 240g of white flour, now use a good strong <time_token_13> <time_token_16> bread flour for this, a quarter teaspoon of salt, half a tablespoon of sugar and a teaspoon of dried <time_token_16> <time_token_19> yeast. Now to start off, just put the yeast and the sugar into that water, give it a quick stir <time_token_19> <time_token_22> together and set it aside in a warm place for half an hour, this will get the yeast going. And what <time_token_22> <time_token_24> we're looking for here is that foam on top, so it's time to make the rest of our dough. So add <time_token_24> <time_token_30> the salt into the flour, followed by the egg, the melted butter, the yeast sugar and water mix, <time_token_30> <time_token_33> then combine well and knead it until the dough is smooth. This will take about 10 or so minutes, <time_token_35> <time_token_37> then cover it in a lightly floured container and leave it in a warm place to rise for about an <time_token_37> <time_token_39> hour. Now this is enough dough to make 20 or 25 of these, so I'm just using half of it here today, <time_token_39> <time_token_42> of course you can use this mixture to make normal sized bread rolls too. So roll out that dough <time_token_42> <time_token_45> until it's about three quarters of a centimetre thick and what I'm doing here is using a melon <time_token_45> <time_token_47> baller to cut out these mini discs from it. They're about an inch or so in diameter, then brush with <time_token_47> <time_token_51> a bit of egg wash and sprinkle over some sesame seeds. Now I've got the barbecue set up for indirect <time_token_51> <time_token_53> cooking, 180 degrees Celsius, cook with the lid down, of course use your oven if you like and <time_token_53> <time_token_56> these will take 8 to 10 minutes to cook and these are delicious to eat on their own as well. So now <time_token_56> <time_token_58> for the rest of the burger, 200 grams of beef mince, here I've got some bacon which I've cut <time_token_58> <time_token_60> into squares, some cheese slices which are also cut into squares, some mini Roma tomatoes which <time_token_60> <time_token_64> I've sliced, some rocket and some barbecue sauce, of course use whichever condiments you like. Now <time_token_64> <time_token_66> I'm just giving this beef a light seasoning with some salt and pepper, mix it together well and <time_token_66> <time_token_67> then between two sheets of baking paper, gently roll it out until it's about a half centimetre <time_token_67> <time_token_69> thick and once that's done, put it into the freezer for about 20 minutes and this will help it all hold <time_token_69> <time_token_72> together. Now to cut out the burgers, I'm just using a glass here, you can use a small cookie cutter <time_token_72> <time_token_73> if you like and you want to cut them to a size that's about a centimetre or two larger in diameter <time_token_73> <time_token_74> than your rolls because these will shrink as you cook them. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Then simply cook the bacon and the burgers on a medium hot barbecue plate <time_token_79> <time_token_80> and when they're about half done, just place those slices of cheese onto the burgers <time_token_80> <time_token_83> followed by the squares of bacon and cook it until it melts and now to assemble the burgers. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> So cut one of those mini rolls in half, put the burger cheese and bacon on top <time_token_85> <time_token_86> followed by a bit of that barbecue sauce, a cherry tomato, <time_token_86> <time_token_88> a bit of rocket, the top bun and stick a toothpick through it. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Now repeat this process for all of your mini burgers. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Now serve them to your guests or eat them yourself. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> These are absolutely awesome guys, be sure to give them a go. <time_token_93> <time_token_95> Drop me a comment below and tell me what is your favourite entertaining finger food. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> Check out my other videos and subscribe for regular updates. <time_token_96> <time_token_98> Thanks for watching and I'll catch you all next time.

Alright this recipe calls for a few things here. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> First one is two onions. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> One onion will be chopped up finely, will be mixed in with one pound of hamburger meat <time_token_5> <time_token_6> and I have all the various spices over here that's going to complete this chili. <time_token_6> <time_token_8> A coney dog is nothing more but the hot dog Frankfurter, the chili sauce with just mustard <time_token_8> <time_token_8> and raw onions on top. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> That is the original coney island and that's what we're doing here today. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> So let's go ahead and get started by chopping up these onions. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> Like I said you want them fairly fine and I have a little helper here that will help <time_token_12> <time_token_12> me make this in short order, it does a really good job. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> Just like that. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Alright I got one pound of ground beef, I'm going to add in about half of these onions <time_token_17> <time_token_17> which would be about one whole onion. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> These are the ones that I just chopped up rather fine. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> And we're going to reserve the remainder of these onions for the hot dog itself. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Alright also into this I'm going to add two cloves of garlic that's been minced up. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> We'll stir all this in and brown well. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> Okay I've been going around five minutes just browning this meat up. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> By the way this is a 93.7, 93 percent lean, 7 percent fat and all we're really coming <time_token_25> <time_token_26> up with is mainly water and so we're not going to drain this. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> There will be a little bit of oil in it, a little bit of grease, but not enough to <time_token_27> <time_token_28> really hurt anything. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> So at this point we're going to take two tablespoons of chili powder. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> I'm using the Maxine chili powder. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> We're also going to put in one tablespoon of cumin. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> That's two tablespoons of chili powder, one tablespoon of cumin. <time_token_32> <time_token_32> We're going to add this in, we're going to let this cook about an additional three minutes. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Alright I'm going to add in about a cup of water. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Also going to add in one six ounce can of tomato paste. <time_token_35> <time_token_37> Alright I'm going to go ahead and work this in really good and get all this blended and <time_token_37> <time_token_37> mixed in well and we'll be back. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> Alright now I want to add in some salt. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> We haven't seasoned this yet with salt. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Probably going to get about a half a teaspoon of salt. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Alright now into this you want to add one tablespoon of just plain old yellow prepared <time_token_42> <time_token_43> One tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> We're going to mix this in good. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Alright the last and final ingredient is around two teaspoons of brown sugar. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> Maybe just a tad more. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> That should be plenty. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Alright I'm going to mix this in good. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> We're just going to let it simmer here for a few more minutes and this is basically done. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> I've been letting this simmer for around five more minutes. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Looking really good. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> About the right thickness. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Just tasted it. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> This stuff is good. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> It's going to be really good on a chili dog. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> Alright what I'm going to do at this point is I'm going to slide this off the heat and <time_token_55> <time_token_55> I'm going to swap places with this little steamer here. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> We're going to go ahead and put this on high and we're getting ready to steam some hot <time_token_56> <time_token_57> dog wieners and some buns. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Alright I've got these all beef New York style frankfurters going on. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Got them steaming. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> They're about four minutes and about another minute I'm going to add the buns and let <time_token_59> <time_token_60> them steam for one minute. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> This is a very close replica to the original Coney Island. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> The Coney Island dog up there in Michigan. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> From doing this hot dog series if I haven't learned anything I've learned one thing that <time_token_63> <time_token_64> there are many variations to all of these dogs. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> The Detroit Coney Island it uses a thinner sauce. <time_token_65> <time_token_67> This is a thicker sauce and I'm sure there's other variations as well. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Different toppings such as that. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> But what I've presented to you today is the basic Coney Island recipe as it started. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> Alright this Coney Island dog is about as simple as it gets. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> We got a steam bun nice and soft. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> From there we're going to take the New York style all beef kosher type hot dog wiener. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Right now from here we're just going to put this chili on that we made. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Tell you what that really looks good, smells good, and tastes good. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Alright all we get from there is just more mustard on top. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> You know we got mustard inside the chili. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> We're going to put more on top. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> We're going to top it with raw onions and that is it. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> That is the Coney Island. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> This is going to be good. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> Let's give this a taste test. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Alright here we go. <time_token_81> <time_token_85> Oh yeah it's very hot but delicious. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> This is the keeper. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> This is good. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> Alright people this is actually going to be my last hot dog in this series for a while. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> I will be adding some more hot dog recipes as I go and throw them on that playlist. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> But I have got so many products that I've got to do reviews on that people have been <time_token_90> <time_token_90> sending me and mailing me and I'm really getting behind. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> So it's time for me to move on to bigger and better things. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> So I hope you enjoyed everything up to now. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> I've got four different hot dog videos up and we covered some really good

thank all the viewers from all over the world for giving me some fantastic <time_token_2> <time_token_3> I am so glad that you all are watching my videos and enjoying my recipes. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> So today I am going to do a very traditional recipe which is the vegetable and mint Shahi <time_token_4> <time_token_5> Now Biryani's can be very daunting with loads of ingredients and cooking techniques. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> But I assure you though the ingredient list is quite big, it is very simple to make. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> So to know more about this recipe, stay tuned to India Food Network. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> So though the ingredient list is really long, the cooking technique is very simple and I <time_token_10> <time_token_11> assure you that the Biryani will be ready in no time. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> So let's see what the ingredients are. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> Here I have 2 cups of rice that I have cooked in some salted water and added some saffron <time_token_12> <time_token_13> Here I have half a cup of potatoes that I have fried. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> About 1.5 cups of boiled vegetables like cauliflower, carrots, peas, French beans. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> About half a cup of fried onions, some fried cashew nuts, soaked raisins, 1 tomato which <time_token_16> <time_token_18> I have chopped, some fresh mint, coriander, 1 cup of yogurt, 2 tablespoons of fresh cream <time_token_18> <time_token_20> 2 tablespoons of grated cheese, quarter teaspoon of haldi or turmeric, 1 teaspoon of red chilli <time_token_20> <time_token_21> powder, 2 teaspoons of dana jeera powder, about 1 to 1.5 teaspoons of biryani masala, <time_token_21> <time_token_22> about 2 teaspoons of ginger garlic which I have chopped, some salt to taste and 2 tablespoons <time_token_23> <time_token_23> So after all these ingredients, let's find out how to make this quick biryani. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> So because the ingredient list is so long, what I do is I just plop all these ingredients <time_token_24> <time_token_25> into one big bowl and marinate the vegetables. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> So first let's get the vegetables in this bowl. <time_token_26> <time_token_32> And now I am going to add the yogurt, the fresh cream, the cheese, then the mint, of <time_token_32> <time_token_32> course the most important ingredient. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Some nice freshly chopped coriander which gives all the freshness, quarter teaspoon <time_token_34> <time_token_37> of haldi or turmeric, 1 teaspoon of chilli powder, 2 teaspoons of dana jeera powder, <time_token_37> <time_token_40> about 1 to 1.5 teaspoons of biryani masala, some salt to taste and of course the tomatoes. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> So now I am going to simply mix all these ingredients so that they mix and blend well. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> Now last add the potatoes because we don't want them to get too soggy and a bit of the <time_token_44> <time_token_44> onions, maybe a tablespoon or so. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Okay so really there are two ways of doing this biryani. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> You can just layer these vegetables as is in a pot or a pan that you are making your <time_token_46> <time_token_48> biryani in and then just layer the rice over it and let cook covered for about 30 to 40 <time_token_48> <time_token_48> minutes on a low flame. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> So you don't have to wait and watch and you can sip a wine while the biryani is working. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Just remember to place a pan underneath the cooking pot so that the heat distributes evenly <time_token_50> <time_token_51> So now I have marinated the vegetables for a good 15 to 20 minutes. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> So I am just going to saute them now. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> So just put it on medium heat. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> I am going to add 2 tablespoons of regular vegetable oil. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> You can also add ghee here or butter. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> And once the oil heats up I am going to add the ginger and the garlic just to remove the <time_token_56> <time_token_56> rawness from that. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> Saute it for a couple of minutes and now simply plop in all these ingredients into <time_token_63> <time_token_64> So now I am going to let these vegetables cook for a good 5 to 6 minutes till all the <time_token_64> <time_token_65> flavours blend in while I prepare the rice for it. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> So here I have some salted cooked rice and in that I have put some saffron. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> So a good tip here would be to dissolve the saffron in some milk to make it more rich <time_token_67> <time_token_68> and so that the colour and the flavour spreads evenly. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> So here I have the rice and to this I am going to add some fried onions. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> And just mix it nicely and remember to flavour it with some salt at this point in time otherwise <time_token_71> <time_token_72> the biryani can get quite bland. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> So now my vegetables are almost cooked here. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> It doesn't take much time because we already par-boiled our vegetables before. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> So now just spread it evenly in a layer. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Just reduce the temperature to low. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> And now I am going to simply layer the rice on top. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> So it's got all the goodness of vegetables. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> You can add percocote cheese, you can add some chicken, I mean whatever you like. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> Finally I am going to add some soaked raisins. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> So why we add it right now? <time_token_80> <time_token_81> The rice soaks and all the sweetness and gives it a really rich and decadent taste <time_token_82> <time_token_82> And the fried onion. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> And now I am going to place a foil or any tight container or something on top. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> So now I have placed this foil over the pan. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Just make sure that all the steam gets trapped. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> So now we are going to let this biryani sit for about 10 to 15 minutes on a very low flame <time_token_86> <time_token_87> till the entire house is full of the fantastic flavor. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> So after 15 minutes I am just checking if it's done. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> It looks fantastic and most divine. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> The final garnish would be to top some fried cashews on top just to make it that royal <time_token_90> <time_token_91> and shahi and some really freshly chopped coriander. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> So my vegetable and mint shahi biryani is ready. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> I hope you enjoyed watching this video and I am sure you are going to try to make it. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> Do leave me suggestions and comments and let me know if you have liked it. <time_token_94>

Cover the bamboo sushi roll <time_token_56> <time_token_59> mat with a plastic wrap so that the rice won't stick onto the bamboo sushi roll mat. Divide <time_token_60> <time_token_66> the rice into 4. Cut lotus seaweed into half. Place it on a bamboo sushi roll mat. Make sure you wet <time_token_66> <time_token_70> your hands with water and spread the sushi rice on nourish it using your fingertips. Sprinkle the <time_token_70> <time_token_74> sesame seeds over the sushi rice and then turn it over. Place crab meat and avocado lengthwise. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> Hold the line of ingredients firmly miss your fingers. Stop and leave about 1.3 inch of sushi <time_token_78> <time_token_83> rice and then roll it completely. And then gently press the mat around the roll and shape it. With <time_token_83> <time_token_86> a moistened knife, cut the roll into 6 pieces. Make sure you wet the knife when the rice starts <time_token_86> <time_token_92> to stick onto your knife. Don't push and pull to cut. And put them on the plate. Serve with soy sauce <time_token_92> <time_token_96> and wasabi if you like. Thanks for watching. I hope you enjoyed.

So for the month of January I'm sharing with you <time_token_7> <time_token_8> guys my favorite breakfast recipes and today we're gonna be making a BLT <time_token_8> <time_token_9> breakfast sandwich. We're gonna be making our own avocado spread using <time_token_9> <time_token_10> spring greens, tomatoes and of course bacon. It's a super easy recipe that you <time_token_10> <time_token_11> can even make for your everyday breakfast. So we're gonna start by <time_token_11> <time_token_12> making our avocado spread. We're gonna need one ripe large avocado and we're <time_token_12> <time_token_14> gonna split it in half and you want to remove the pit and I'm gonna use a fork <time_token_14> <time_token_16> and just scrape all that flesh out of the avocado into small bowl and this way <time_token_16> <time_token_17> you're mashing it up and removing it at the same time. It's a really simple <time_token_17> <time_token_19> technique. We're gonna add juice from one lime. I'm just gonna roll it on my <time_token_19> <time_token_20> counter to release all those juices from the flesh. Just squeeze it into the <time_token_20> <time_token_22> avocado and this is gonna first help preserve the color of the avocado and <time_token_22> <time_token_23> secondly it's gonna give it a really zesty flavor. Actually this half looks <time_token_23> <time_token_25> like it's perfect. Just gonna go ahead and stir it in there. I'm also gonna add <time_token_25> <time_token_26> about a tablespoon of olive oil. Just gonna add a little bit of creaminess <time_token_26> <time_token_27> and we're gonna season it with just a pinch of salt. I'm gonna give this a quick <time_token_27> <time_token_29> stir. I'm gonna set it aside and next we're gonna make our bacon. To make our <time_token_29> <time_token_30> bacon super crispy I've preheated my oven to 375 degrees and I've lined a <time_token_30> <time_token_31> baking sheet with some foil and then placed a cooling rack over the top. So to <time_token_31> <time_token_32> make our bacon all we're gonna do is we're gonna lay it over the top of the <time_token_32> <time_token_34> cooling rack and once this is in the oven it's gonna make a perfect bacon <time_token_34> <time_token_35> slice. It's gonna be crispy. You're not gonna have all that excess oil since <time_token_35> <time_token_36> it's gonna drip down to the bottom and make sure to line it with the foil on <time_token_36> <time_token_37> the bottom. It's gonna collect all the fat and that's gonna have you're gonna <time_token_37> <time_token_38> have super easy cleanup. Just throw the foil away in the garbage. So pop this <time_token_38> <time_token_39> into the oven. It's gonna take about 10-15 minutes. For this recipe I like to <time_token_39> <time_token_40> use a firmer artisan bread. So you want to slice it into about half inch slices <time_token_40> <time_token_42> and then we're gonna place this onto a pan and I like to toast these under the <time_token_42> <time_token_43> broiler in the oven. It's super fast and super easy. So today I'm gonna be making <time_token_43> <time_token_44> two sandwiches. We're gonna need four slices. For today's recipe we're gonna be <time_token_44> <time_token_45> using sunny side up eggs. So the secret to making them is cooking them slowly <time_token_45> <time_token_46> over low heat. So I've sprayed a large pan with some nonstick spray. We're <time_token_46> <time_token_48> gonna add our eggs and we're gonna let them cook slowly. And I like to use <time_token_48> <time_token_49> organic eggs simply because the egg yolk is gonna be raw and you want to make <time_token_49> <time_token_51> sure you have the freshest best eggs. We're gonna also season these with a <time_token_51> <time_token_52> little bit of salt and pepper. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> My eggs and bacon are finishing up. Meanwhile we're gonna start assembling <time_token_55> <time_token_57> the sandwich. So we need to slice our tomatoes into nice thin slices. So I've <time_token_57> <time_token_58> toasted my bread on one side and I left it playing on the inside. So we're gonna <time_token_58> <time_token_59> spread one side with the avocado spread that we prepared earlier and I like to <time_token_59> <time_token_60> add lots of avocado. I absolutely love it in my sandwiches and I want to get a <time_token_60> <time_token_62> bite of it in every single bite. Spread that and then on the other side we're <time_token_62> <time_token_63> gonna add just a touch of olive oil mayonnaise and I like to use this olive <time_token_63> <time_token_65> oil mayonnaise. I think it has better flavor than just regular plain old <time_token_65> <time_token_66> mayonnaise. Spread a little bit and you can add more or less to your liking. And <time_token_66> <time_token_67> now for assembling our sandwiches we're gonna add a little bit of our spring <time_token_67> <time_token_69> greens over the top of our avocado spread. Just lightly press them in and <time_token_69> <time_token_71> then over our lettuce we're gonna add our tomatoes. And this way the tomatoes <time_token_71> <time_token_72> aren't gonna make the bread soggy. And now for our baking so once I took it out <time_token_72> <time_token_73> of the oven I just placed it on some paper towels. They're gonna soak up any <time_token_73> <time_token_75> excess fat that's on the top. We're gonna add two slices for each sandwich and you <time_token_75> <time_token_77> can break it up too. Just kind of layer it over the top like this. Perfect. And now <time_token_77> <time_token_78> with a finishing touch is our sunny side of egg. So you want to make sure you cook <time_token_78> <time_token_79> these eggs until the whites are completely set so you don't get any food <time_token_79> <time_token_81> poisoning. So we just want to slide this egg over the top and this is ready to be <time_token_81> <time_token_82> eaten. And now it's time to give our sandwich a try. And I actually prefer to <time_token_82> <time_token_83> eat these open-faced so there's less bread and more sandwich. Try to get a <time_token_83> <time_token_83> good bite out of this. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> This is absolutely delicious. This is like the best breakfast sandwich ever. I <time_token_89> <time_token_91> absolutely love this sandwich. I love the zesty avocado, that crunchy bacon, the <time_token_91> <time_token_92> tomato, the lettuce, everything really brings it together. And this is such an <time_token_92> <time_token_93> easy recipe to make. You can make it you know first thing in the morning for your <time_token_93> <time_token_94> breakfast before you go to work.

making vegetable egg rolls. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> They're also known as spring rolls, but my mom has always called them egg rolls. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> This is, in fact, my mom's famous Chinese egg roll recipe, which I learned from her. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> These egg rolls are so incredibly light and crispy, super, super crispy. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> The filling is delicate and full of vegetables like bamboo shoots, Chinese black mushrooms, <time_token_6> <time_token_6> bean sprouts, cabbage, and carrots. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> And of all recipes I've ever made, this is by far one of the most popular. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> All right, let's start with cabbage. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> I'm using Napa cabbage, but you can use regular cabbage, whatever you'd like. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> If you're using Napa cabbage, go ahead and cut it down the middle, just like this, and <time_token_9> <time_token_10> go ahead and start shredding. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> You can also do this in the food processor, but you know what? <time_token_10> <time_token_11> I found it's just easier to clean, to shred them with a knife than to use a food processor. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> The carrots, you julienne them with a knife or a food processor, or you can buy already <time_token_12> <time_token_13> pre-cut, matchstick-cut carrots. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Or you can use my favorite way with this $5 oxo julienne tool, which does it very, very <time_token_14> <time_token_16> I use a fork to anchor down the carrot, and look how thin and beautiful these julienne <time_token_16> <time_token_16> I'm just going to cut down the length just a bit. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> These are canned bamboo shoots. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> You'll find them in the Asian aisle. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> I drain them, and I'm just going to run my knife through them, just to make them similar <time_token_18> <time_token_18> shape and size as the carrots. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Now for the mushrooms. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> You can use fresh shiitake mushrooms, if you'd like, or really any type of mushrooms you <time_token_20> <time_token_20> But these are dried Chinese mushrooms. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> They come in dried form, just like this, and you rehydrate them by soaking them in water. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Add incredible flavors, a savory, deep mushroom flavor that you really can't get with just <time_token_22> <time_token_23> So that's why I love using dried Chinese mushrooms. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Pinch off and discard the tough stem, and chop up the cap. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> These are bean sprouts. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> There's a tail, and there's a head. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> And what you want to do is pinch off and discard the tails, which is really the root, and keep <time_token_26> <time_token_26> the rest of it. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> When I was little, my mom used to make me do this all the time. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> It was so incredibly tedious. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> So you know what? <time_token_27> <time_token_27> I'm sorry, mom. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> I'm not going to do it. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> Just throwing it all in. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> Heat up a wok, or a large saute pan, and add in your ginger, garlic, and green onion. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> Keep your heat on low. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> You don't want to burn these aromatics. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Add in the vegetables, everything but the bean sprouts. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> Add the bean sprouts in later because you want them to stay crisp and crunchy. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Stir-fry, and now when it's almost towards the end of the stir-fry, add in your bean <time_token_33> <time_token_33> Season with soy sauce. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> Here's a secret tip. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Once you're done with the stir-fry, lay everything, all the vegetables out, on a baking sheet. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> This cools down the filling very quickly. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> The reason why this is important is because if you try to use hot, steaming hot filling <time_token_36> <time_token_37> to wrap with, it'll make the skin of the egg roll really soggy. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> Also another tip, prop up the baking sheet so that any extra oil or sauce or juices collects <time_token_38> <time_token_39> at the bottom, and you can throw that away. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> Any extra liquid. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> This helps prevent your egg roll, again, from being soggy. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Mix cool water with cornstarch to make a slurry. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> This is sort of your glue. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> You can also use an egg wash if you want, but I like using cornstarch and water. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> This is my very favorite brand of egg roll wrappers or spring roll shells. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> You get these at the Asian market. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> You'll find them in the frozen section, and you'll defrost them in the refrigerator overnight <time_token_44> <time_token_44> or just leave them out on your counter for about 45 minutes. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> They're incredibly thin and very, very light, and they crisp up like crazy. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> The wrappers that you can find at regular supermarkets that are not frozen there, usually <time_token_47> <time_token_48> near the tofu in the vegetable aisle, I don't like those at all. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> They're too thick. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> They bubble up, and they're just too doughy, so I always buy these wrappers. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Another good brand that I also buy is called Spring Hill. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Tip, keep them wrapped up in plastic wrap or a damp paper towel because they will dry <time_token_51> <time_token_51> out very easily, and it's very hard to roll. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Make sure your work surface is dry and clean. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> That's also very important. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Lay down your wrapper in a diamond shape. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Add about a heaping tablespoon of filling. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> You don't want to add too much because it'll burst if you add too much filling. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Roll them up super, super tight. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Put your finger right there to make a fold, a nice hospital corner fold. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Again on the other side, and roll all the way up. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> Now, this is what you do not want to do. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Do you see how it looks a little wide there? <time_token_58> <time_token_58> There's basically an opening. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> Oil can seep in it. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Make sure egg rolls very oily. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> You want to make sure that you're folding them so that there's no air bubbles, no pockets, <time_token_60> <time_token_60> and no holes. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> Paint the remaining corners with the cornstarch slurry and roll all the way up, and tugging <time_token_62> <time_token_62> back just a bit every time just so that you've got a very tight roll. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> That is it. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> Okay, I'll show you again. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Step one is to wipe down your surface. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> Lay down the egg roll wrapper in a diamond shape, and add just about a heaping tablespoon <time_token_65> <time_token_66> of filling into this bottom corner right here. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> Roll up tightly. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Roll up that corner, and tug back just a bit just to make sure it's tight. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Use your finger to pinch. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> And roll the rest of the way up. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Paint the two corners with the cornstarch slurry. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> I'll show you what it looks like. <time_token_69> <time_token_71> It should look tight, small, maybe about an inch and a quarter in diameter, and no visible <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Put them, lay them flat on a baking sheet. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Make sure you cover it with a damp towel, a very, very damp towel, or plastic wrap to <time_token_72> <time_token_72> prevent them from drying. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Here's another tip. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> If you'd like to freeze them, freeze them just like this, or just make sure that they <time_token_74> <time_token_74> are all on a single layer. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Try not to have them touch. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Freeze them first. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> And then once they are frozen, you can gather them up and put them in a freezer bag. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> If you try to squish them too tight or have them overlapping while in the freezer, they'll <time_token_76> <time_token_77> just freeze in a giant clump, and then you won't be able to get them apart. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> And to cook them frozen, all you have to do is put them directly frozen into the hot oil. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Just be very careful. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> You don't need to defrost them. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> Okay, back to the fresh egg rolls. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> I've got some hot oil, and I've got a baking sheet with a rack to drain them. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> And I'm going to make sure that the oil is hot enough. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> Here's a tip that I learned from my mom. <time_token_81> <time_token_83> Take a uncoated chopstick or a wooden spoon, the handle of a wooden spoon, and place it <time_token_83> <time_token_83> in the oil. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> I promise you're not going to damage your chopstick or wooden spoon. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Place it into the oil, and if you see no bubbles, it's not quite ready yet. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> When you do see bubbles, that's when your oil is hot enough to fry. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> It's called the ancient Chinese thermometer. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> You can see here that it's not quite ready yet. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> Okay, a couple minutes later, you can see bubbles coming out. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Slide in the egg rolls very carefully. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Don't make sure you don't splatter yourself. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> And just fry until brown. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> Remember, the filling is already cooked inside. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> We stir-fried that earlier, so really, all you're doing is browning the outside. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> When I also wanted to tell you how my dad likes to enjoy the egg rolls, you take one <time_token_90> <time_token_92> bite from the egg roll and pour in a little bit of Chinese black vinegar, or if you don't <time_token_92> <time_token_93> have Chinese black vinegar, just a little bit of balsamic vinegar, and the sweet, tangy <time_token_93> <time_token_94> sharpness of the vinegar, oh, it's perfect for Chinese egg rolls. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> For the full

So let's start by showing you how we <time_token_7> <time_token_9> prepare and clean bok choy. I like to cut off the ends so this way we could <time_token_9> <time_token_10> easily wash them cleanly because all the dirt is in the base of the bok choy we <time_token_10> <time_token_12> could separate it. I already pre-washed all of all of this so for a sake of <time_token_12> <time_token_14> saving time. Now let's move on to the udon noodles. You can pick up any of these <time_token_14> <time_token_16> type of udon noodles in just about every grocery store under the Sun. So we'll just <time_token_16> <time_token_18> open this up and to save time I already pre-opened five of them and here <time_token_18> <time_token_21> we go. I have already started a pot of water here and in this pot of water I <time_token_21> <time_token_22> have added a can of chicken broth so I don't have to <time_token_22> <time_token_24> use so much of the soup flavoring that it comes in a package but I will add <time_token_24> <time_token_26> for the sake of flavoring that it's for this type of noodles I will add about <time_token_26> <time_token_28> maybe a couple packs of this and you see this is so simple and it'll come very <time_token_28> <time_token_32> close to what you'll find in a typical Japanese restaurant. You can add any other <time_token_32> <time_token_34> type of meat but this comes closer to allow the Asian flavoring and we'll let <time_token_34> <time_token_34> that boil just a little bit. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Since this takes a little bit longer to cook I'll let this cook a little bit <time_token_37> <time_token_39> first before I add in the vegetables. Now like I've said earlier we don't have <time_token_39> <time_token_40> to use bok chard, we could just use any frozen vegetable <time_token_41> <time_token_42> and it'll work just fine. We can add a little bit here <time_token_42> <time_token_44> however much that you want to make. I'm making almost I'm making five servings <time_token_44> <time_token_46> So it just comes up to a boil in just a minute. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> I am going to start to add the udon noodles and we don't want to boil the <time_token_51> <time_token_52> udon noodles too long otherwise they lose all their texture in the way <time_token_52> <time_token_54> they're supposed to be. So let's start adding the udon noodles <time_token_54> <time_token_58> This seems like I'm going to start to overflow this a little bit, I hope we're under-estimated. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> The amount of soup that I originally put in there so I'll take some of it out. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> I'm going to put some of this vegetable in there. <time_token_67> <time_token_71> Let that come up to a boil a little bit and we are done. <time_token_74> <time_token_79> See you could get some of the noodles start separating them a little bit. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> As you can see they're cooking very nicely. <time_token_82> <time_token_88> So this this pot of noodles being able to serve five <time_token_88> <time_token_90> costs 50 cents a pack on the noodles to as much as 80 cents a pack. The vegetable <time_token_90> <time_token_92> costs about a dollar. I put in a can of chicken broth and that typically is <time_token_92> <time_token_93> about a dollar and the fish balls are about three bucks for the pack. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> And if you do the math this is I would guess somewhere under ten bucks and <time_token_95> <time_token_96> we're going to serve a pot of noodles that will serve five people.

Tonight for dinner I'm going to make a cottage pie. This <time_token_3> <time_token_4> was a recipe that was requested by one of my viewers, Dylan, and I really didn't know <time_token_4> <time_token_6> what a cottage pie was. I did a little research and found out that cottage pie and shepherd's <time_token_6> <time_token_7> pie are the same thing. I am familiar with a shepherd's pie, and so this is what I'm <time_token_7> <time_token_9> making for dinner tonight, and I hope that you enjoy it, Dylan. The amounts of the ingredients <time_token_9> <time_token_10> that you're going to need for this pie will be listed in the information box below, or <time_token_10> <time_token_12> you can find it on the website. The meat portion of the pie ingredients are ground beef, kitchen <time_token_12> <time_token_13> bouquet, and this is what this kitchen bouquet looks like if you're not familiar with it. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> You can just find this in the regular grocery store. You're going to need water, wish to <time_token_14> <time_token_16> shear sauce, chopped onions, canola or vegetable oil, all-purpose flour, dry thyme, and you're <time_token_16> <time_token_17> going to need a couple of bouillon cubes. You'll also need a casserole dish that you <time_token_17> <time_token_19> have sprayed with cooking spray. I'm going to put a potato layer on top of the ground <time_token_19> <time_token_21> beef. To make the mashed potatoes, you're going to need these ingredients. You'll need <time_token_21> <time_token_22> some red potatoes, some butter, salt, white ground pepper, nutmeg, heavy cream, and egg <time_token_22> <time_token_24> yolk, and to top it all off after we have the beef and the potatoes all done, we're <time_token_24> <time_token_26> going to sprinkle on some cheddar cheese. I'm going to put my oil in my pan and let <time_token_26> <time_token_27> it get a little bit hot. I'm doing a little rippling and you can tell it's hot when it <time_token_27> <time_token_29> starts making little lines. I'm going to add my onions. We're going to saute these onions <time_token_29> <time_token_32> until they're soft and a little bit translucent. My onions are getting soft, so I'm going to <time_token_32> <time_token_35> add my ground beef. We're going to break this up. I'm going to cook this until it's done <time_token_35> <time_token_37> and no longer pink. The ground beef is ready, so now what I'm going to do is add in my flour. <time_token_38> <time_token_41> I'm going to stir that a little bit. I'm going to add in my thyme and my bouillon cubes, <time_token_41> <time_token_44> my Worcestershire and my kitchen bouquet, and two cups of water. I'm going to turn it up <time_token_44> <time_token_47> and bring it to a boil. My beef mixture is boiling, so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to <time_token_47> <time_token_49> turn the heat down and let it simmer for about 30 minutes. The beef part of this shepherd's pie <time_token_49> <time_token_50> is done, so I wanted to put it in to the bottom of the casserole, so I'm using this spoon, <time_token_50> <time_token_52> and I'm just going to cover the whole entire bottom of the casserole with the beef. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Now what I'm going to do is set this aside for just a minute, and we're going to move on to our mashed potatoes. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> I've peeled and cubed my potatoes. I've put them in a pot and covered them with water, <time_token_58> <time_token_59> and now I'm going to bring them to a boil, then I'm going to turn them down and let them simmer <time_token_59> <time_token_59> for about 20 minutes until they're tender. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Okay, my potatoes are done. I've drained them, and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my <time_token_62> <time_token_63> potato masher, and I'm just going to start mashing them. <time_token_64> <time_token_68> Okay, I'm going to add my butter, the salt and the pepper, the egg yolk, the heavy cream. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> I'm going to grate a little nutmeg. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Continue to mash. <time_token_72> <time_token_75> Okay, my mashed potatoes are done, so now we're going to spread these over the top of our ground beef mixture. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> If you want to do this a different way, you can put it in a piping bag and pipe it on. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> I'm just going to spread it. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Okay, my potatoes are spread across the top of the beef, and now I'm going to take the cheddar cheese <time_token_83> <time_token_83> and sprinkle it on top. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> I've preheated my oven to 350 degrees, and I'm going to put my shepherd's cottage pie in, <time_token_88> <time_token_89> and I'm going to bake it for 30 minutes. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> My cottage shepherd's pie is done. It cooked for 30 minutes. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> This is what it looks like right out of the oven, and now I'm going to serve some. <time_token_91> <time_token_94> This is cottage pie or shepherd's pie, whichever you prefer to call it, and I hope you enjoy it.

Welcome back to another <time_token_2> <time_token_2> session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today I'm going to show you <time_token_2> <time_token_3> another favorite of mine I'm very surprised while I was checking the list <time_token_3> <time_token_3> of the dishes I did <time_token_3> <time_token_4> I did not make mutton rogan josh. Dear friends this is one of the tastiest and <time_token_4> <time_token_5> super awesome dish from Kashmir. You know this is the dish what I learned from the <time_token_5> <time_token_6> master chefs only in feist hotels but I have seen in lot of restaurant they serve <time_token_6> <time_token_7> mutton rogan josh, they just serve the mutton curry and call it rogan josh and <time_token_7> <time_token_8> it doesn't have the punch what rogan josh must have. You know lot of people add <time_token_8> <time_token_9> onion, tomato and all this in making me rogan josh but what I'm going to do <time_token_9> <time_token_10> today I'm not going to add onion nor tomatoes nor even yogurt you know if you <time_token_10> <time_token_10> want you can add a little bit of yogurt but I'm not even going to add yogurt so <time_token_10> <time_token_11> for this the spices what we're going to add is javitri that is mace, cinnamon, <time_token_11> <time_token_12> green cardamom, cumin seeds, black cardamom and saffron you know I'm going <time_token_12> <time_token_13> to make a powder of these four and add while as I black hilachi or the black <time_token_13> <time_token_14> cardamom and cook the meat with it. Now here I've got one and of tablespoon of <time_token_14> <time_token_15> chilli powder not any chilli powder, Kashmiri chilli powder that is what will <time_token_15> <time_token_16> give nice red color, ginger powder but one tablespoon of fennel seed powder and <time_token_16> <time_token_17> we're going to add this in this quantity and that will give a very nice tasteful gravy. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Now to make it very simple I'm going to mix all of these masalas together so you <time_token_18> <time_token_19> will understand so here I've got hing powder you know hing is a must for <time_token_19> <time_token_20> matan rogan josh and in this add kashmiri chilli powder, ginger powder and fennel <time_token_20> <time_token_22> seed powder and in this add water and mix this into a watery paste and now we're <time_token_22> <time_token_23> going to add in a blender I'm going to add the cumin seeds, green cardamom, cinnamon <time_token_23> <time_token_24> sticks and javitri that is mace I'm going to powder and add it so make it a nice <time_token_24> <time_token_25> coarse powder, ghee you know you're not going to cook it in the oil this matan rogan <time_token_25> <time_token_26> josh needs to be cooked in nice desi ghee. When this desi ghee heats up we're going to add <time_token_26> <time_token_27> badi hilachi that is black cardamom that will give a nice flavor to this dish and <time_token_27> <time_token_28> here I've got meat this is a nice lamb meat and all these meats have bone dully <time_token_28> <time_token_29> that is the shanks of meat you know and take all the pieces which are like shanks <time_token_29> <time_token_30> and when desis get cooked like this with the bone in the gravy becomes nice and very <time_token_30> <time_token_31> flavorful. Now here the ghee is heated up and my black cardamom is nicely roasted <time_token_31> <time_token_33> in this add pieces of this meat and we're going to cook this meat in this ghee and you have to cook <time_token_33> <time_token_34> till the meat becomes slightly brown that is when you get a very good flavor to the gravy <time_token_34> <time_token_35> you know it is better always to fry the meat like this and then cook it on a slow flame <time_token_35> <time_token_36> you know now look at this meat this is nicely slightly brown and you know this <time_token_36> <time_token_37> method of cooking is used not only in India but throughout the world when you roast the <time_token_37> <time_token_38> meat like this it is called milad effect what it does is it caramelizes the outer coating <time_token_38> <time_token_39> of meat and gives a very nice flavor to this dish now this is all ready now in this we're <time_token_39> <time_token_41> going to add the mixture the paste of the chili powder and soft powder, fennel powder into this <time_token_41> <time_token_42> and you can also add little of saffron you know this will also give a very nice flavor to this <time_token_42> <time_token_44> dish and pour in lot of water to cover the meat you know because I wanted to show you I'm cooking <time_token_44> <time_token_45> in such a big pan otherwise I would have taken a little smaller pan like this but you know to make <time_token_45> <time_token_46> sure that you see what's happening in the pan I took a vessel like this now put the lid on and cook <time_token_46> <time_token_47> it on a slow flame for at least one hour to one and a half hour another easy method of if you don't <time_token_47> <time_token_48> have patience to spend one and a half hour of slow cooking easy method is just pour this into a <time_token_48> <time_token_49> pressure cooker cook it and again transfer it back in this pan because you want this masala salt to <time_token_49> <time_token_50> also to be cooked in a slow method of cooking like this what it does is it evaporates the water <time_token_50> <time_token_51> because we added little extra water in this that water will be evaporated and when the sauce is done <time_token_51> <time_token_52> it has to be liquidy but all the masalas need to be cooked and here is the masala of cumin <time_token_52> <time_token_53> cardamom cinnamon sticks and when you're cooking in the open method like this when this is cooked <time_token_53> <time_token_54> for like half of the time that's almost 45 minutes then we're going to add this but if you do in the <time_token_54> <time_token_55> pressure cooker you know you will have to add it after the meat is cooked after cooking for almost <time_token_55> <time_token_56> 45 minutes now look at this gravy this is nice the oil is also slightly floating on top and you <time_token_56> <time_token_57> can see this meat the lamb bones were not visible when we started but look at this now after 45 <time_token_57> <time_token_58> minutes they're coming off the bone that's when you know that the meat is getting nicely cooked <time_token_58> <time_token_60> now here is the masala powder of maize that is javitri cinnamon cardamom cumin and all this <time_token_60> <time_token_61> and then we're going to add to this this is what will give a nice flavor to your rogan joosh <time_token_61> <time_token_62> just add all of this mix it and we're going to cook this for another 30 minutes at least till the <time_token_62> <time_token_63> time the meat is become nice and tender the meat should be so much cooked that it should be coming <time_token_63> <time_token_64> off the bone and also when it is properly done this meat will literally melt in your mouth that <time_token_64> <time_token_65> is when you got a perfect and a super awesome tasty rogan joes so dear friends you don't need <time_token_65> <time_token_67> to add curd no tomatoes no onions just with these masalas you will not believe how much awesome <time_token_67> <time_token_68> flavor this is already giving so let me put the lid on and if you need to add little water <time_token_68> <time_token_69> you can keep adding little water till you get the desired consistency after cooking it for almost <time_token_69> <time_token_70> another 30 minutes the flavor of rogan joes has spread all over and you can see how the rogan <time_token_70> <time_token_71> rogan means this oil that is floating in red in color look at this that is what makes this <time_token_72> <time_token_73> awesome dish super to look at and tasty also and wow you know if you make it right <time_token_73> <time_token_74> this will taste super fantastic <time_token_74> <time_token_75> it is so good trust me make it the way i've shown you and it will be super fantastic <time_token_77> <time_token_78> dear friends this is something magical this is something super awesome but you use nice <time_token_78> <time_token_79> lamb shanks to make it and take it easy on the ginger powder and you will get nice perfect <time_token_79> <time_token_80> rogan joes you know while we were in the college they always used to add <time_token_80> <time_token_81> ratan joke but when i was in the industry they told no no no ratan joke in this the color should <time_token_81> <time_token_82> come from the kashmiri chilies the flavor the aroma should come from saffron and some people <time_token_82> <time_token_84> also add coxcomb is a kind of a flower which gives also a nice coloring some people add that but <time_token_84> <time_token_85> for me this is super perfect i'm going to switch off the flame and i'm going to enjoy it hot along <time_token_85> <time_token_87> with my naan wow now look at this rogan joes wow what flavors along with this <time_token_88> <time_token_89> um so much perfectly cooked and you know specially when i cook meat like this i want the meat <time_token_89> <time_token_90> to be fully nice and tender but still retain some of the pink color that's the reason why i did not <time_token_90> <time_token_92> add turmeric but some people add if you want you can add turmeric also but dear friends wow <time_token_92> <time_token_93> you know eat with basmati rice or nice Mughalai naan like the one what i'm eating <time_token_93> <time_token_95> this is super and the nice sauce is also nice sticky and super tasty dear friends i hope you <time_token_95> <time_token_96> enjoyed today's session of learning how to make this awesome mutton rogan joes from

We will try to make some quick and simple meal again. This time we'll make <time_token_1> <time_token_2> some stir-fry udon noodles. You can buy these udon packets at the grocery store. There's <time_token_2> <time_token_4> only like 80 cents a pack. Very convenient. So what we did here was we boiled it and we <time_token_4> <time_token_5> mixed in with some, we drained it and we mixed in with some olive oil so that it didn't <time_token_5> <time_token_6> stick. Make sure you fry it with a non-stick pan. And also we mixed it up with some dark <time_token_6> <time_token_8> soy sauce. Over here we have some garlic. This is actually a fish ball that you can <time_token_8> <time_token_8> get at the Asian grocery store. It looks just like this. It's like a fish sausage. And what <time_token_8> <time_token_10> we did was we sliced it up with some pork, some snow peas, some corn, and some bamboo shoots. You <time_token_10> <time_token_12> can just slice these up. You can get all these at the Asian grocery and then one egg is what we're <time_token_12> <time_token_13> going to do. As far as the sauces, we are using one cup, I mean, I'm sorry, one tablespoon of <time_token_13> <time_token_15> Maggi seasoning. That is real tasty stuff. You can replace it with soy sauce. And we also did <time_token_15> <time_token_16> about two tablespoons of hoisin sauce. You can get this at the grocery store as well, <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Asian market. And then one tablespoon of rice wine. Alright, so let's move over here to the wok. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Let's always look at the surface. You put in high heat, look at the surface of the oil. If it's <time_token_20> <time_token_21> kind of bumpy, that means it's ready. And as always, the garlic goes in first. You can turn <time_token_21> <time_token_25> down the heat a little bit so it won't burn. Let it sizzle for a while. The fish ball we have <time_token_25> <time_token_26> already cooked. So the only thing that's not cooked is the little pork that we have. You can <time_token_26> <time_token_27> use chicken or anything you like. Actually, all the ingredients here, you can substitute for <time_token_27> <time_token_29> anything that you prefer. We're going to wine. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> I'm actually going to throw a scrambled egg in here. <time_token_39> <time_token_41> And go through the corn, the beef, and the bamboo. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> We're trying to lighten the color here because the noodles are kind of dark. It'll be a good <time_token_44> <time_token_45> contrast. I'm going to turn the heat back up to high. I'm going to put the maggi sauce in here. <time_token_45> <time_token_47> If you don't like you don't have maggi, you can just use light soy sauce. That will work just fine. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Then I think we're almost ready for the noodles. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Oh, if you like to toss this, let's be careful so it won't fly everywhere. Actually, you have <time_token_57> <time_token_58> the fish balls in here. All these meals here are less than five minutes to cook. You can substitute <time_token_58> <time_token_62> any ingredient you like. If you want spicy, just add spice at your chili peppers. I will put the food on you that we have <time_token_71> <time_token_71> here. It's also kind of sticky. Make sure this is a nonstick, otherwise cleaning will be difficult. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Let's have a taste. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Put some pepper, brown. You can use black pepper or white pepper, whatever you like. <time_token_81> <time_token_85> Finally, a dash of sugar.

How do we make kimchi? What are the ingredients? <time_token_4> <time_token_6> Okay, one head of napa cabbage and you know, you want to trim the <time_token_6> <time_token_7> You know outside just like the head right here just to clean it up a bit um, you just <time_token_7> <time_token_8> Do this just yeah, all you have to do that and then okay <time_token_8> <time_token_8> okay, and then I'm <time_token_8> <time_token_9> For this one. I'm probably going to order it just because these <time_token_9> <time_token_10> Cabbages are very big but what okay just like that and from here. My grandma always used to trim the <time_token_11> <time_token_11> Outside it just a little bit just to clean it up <time_token_11> <time_token_12> About a cup of water and <time_token_12> <time_token_12> rock salt here and <time_token_12> <time_token_13> You know a few students get regular kosher sauce <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Um, I would not I would get the rock salt only because kosher salt has different salt content than the rocks <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Okay, it's a lot saltier. Okay, so <time_token_15> <time_token_15> If you could I would try to get <time_token_15> <time_token_16> the rock salt like this <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Wet it a little bit and then you have to make sure you saw inside to you every <time_token_18> <time_token_18> because that way it is <time_token_19> <time_token_19> all evenly salted I know <time_token_19> <time_token_21> That okay, and then after four hours you'll flip it like that. Okay, so that's eight hours. Yes <time_token_21> <time_token_22> I would say eight to ten and you you really need to taste it make sure it's like it's the salt is embedded into <time_token_22> <time_token_22> After ten hours <time_token_23> <time_token_23> Basically all the moisture went out <time_token_23> <time_token_23> so we're gonna make the <time_token_24> <time_token_24> As you would call it and I am using a lot of ingredients <time_token_24> <time_token_25> But this is very very special if you add this to your kimchi <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Nothing can replicate that <time_token_26> <time_token_27> It's dried fish right this one is dried cod and you can find it then any <time_token_27> <time_token_27> Yeah, any Asian any <time_token_27> <time_token_28> From here. I'm gonna add a little bit of warm water just to you know <time_token_28> <time_token_29> Just a little bit and this way it helps it. Oh, I know the right fishy <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Here and this is for the texture with the case. Yes texture taste and everything is <time_token_30> <time_token_31> scallions here, you know, that's probably one bunch and then <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Apple puree apple puree. I know you know what you can probably just put it all in a food processor and <time_token_33> <time_token_33> This is one apple word. Yeah one apple one apple <time_token_33> <time_token_34> And you're gonna use one apple in this um, I would say half an apple is a quarter cup <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Yeah in ginger I'll probably only use a tablespoon <time_token_36> <time_token_36> You don't want it to be too pungent mean scarlet <time_token_36> <time_token_37> I'm gonna also use probably a little bit more than ginger like two tablespoons. Okay, this is onion puree <time_token_37> <time_token_38> Okay, and I'm gonna use a quarter cup of this <time_token_38> <time_token_39> First one is our salted shrimp, which is acts like a fish sauce. Okay <time_token_40> <time_token_40> Intro into a fish sauce <time_token_41> <time_token_41> Think equal amounts into a fish sauce <time_token_41> <time_token_42> This is Lance fish sauce. Okay <time_token_42> <time_token_43> This is some plum extract, you know or you can <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Like mirin or some a little bit of sugar <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Important this is rice root that I made in advance. Okay. Yeah, so this is like the heart <time_token_45> <time_token_45> This makes like it pasty sticky and <time_token_46> <time_token_47> This is this is actually very so much just rice flour that you boil with a <time_token_47> <time_token_48> You know boil in a pan and with a little water and then <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Yes, so you just simmer it for like 10 minutes I would say and then it becomes like this <time_token_49> <time_token_49> So this I'm gonna add <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Also, I mean anything can pinch you a lot, but this is my first time making one. Yeah. Yeah. I mean <time_token_51> <time_token_52> It is kind of it is quite it seems complicated to see but it's actually if you get used to it <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Okay, we're not that's true <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Yeah, please yeah, please put on a pair of gloves, I would love your help <time_token_54> <time_token_56> A friend, you know, like I love to eat a lot of this a red chili place green red chili place because I like my <time_token_56> <time_token_56> Kinchu spicy, but you know if your tolerance is not as <time_token_56> <time_token_56> Great as mine <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Yes, I think it's not quite spicy, but you know if you add a good amount of it <time_token_58> <time_token_58> First and then I'll add this <time_token_59> <time_token_59> Mix everything everything really well <time_token_61> <time_token_62> You know, it is actually kind of spicy <time_token_62> <time_token_63> But you can really smell yeah, it's not like kimchi like pepper, right? Yeah <time_token_63> <time_token_63> So I just added <time_token_63> <time_token_64> This is very very bad. Yes, very red <time_token_64> <time_token_65> you kind of want to okay do this because that way it becomes a piece and then from here with the <time_token_65> <time_token_66> pepper soaks up the fish sauce and liquid from the <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Daikon and you know all the ingredients it becomes peace. Oh, so, you know, you want to leave it alone in a circular motion <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Yes, circular motion. I kind of like rubbing. I'm rubbing it. Yeah, you have this already now. It's ready. You know, you're ready to <time_token_69> <time_token_69> Put this inside <time_token_69> <time_token_70> Okay, so I'm gonna have easy one. Okay, and I'm gonna do one so you can't do one together. So <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Typically, what do you do this? You just start wrapping it start rubbing it <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Okay, and then under each one you want to add a little bit of paste <time_token_72> <time_token_73> With the daikon, you know, and then you know, you just have to <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Yeah, I mean but imagine <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Hey, you're doing a really good job. Are you sure you never did this before? <time_token_79> <time_token_80> Okay, you would how my grandma did it when she would take the outer <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Don't taste spicy <time_token_83> <time_token_84> It was such a huge device, what do you think? <time_token_85> <time_token_85> It's really crunchy really nice really nice and when it hands up <time_token_85> <time_token_86> It's a little bit spicy sour with a head of sweetness somehow. Uh-huh <time_token_86> <time_token_87> On the apple and you know, and then we did put the plum extract. It's really good. Yeah <time_token_87> <time_token_88> You know fill it all up. We have two more to go to school. You'll work on that for you guys <time_token_88> <time_token_89> I would say for two to three days at room temperature and then you put it in the fridge for five days <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Okay, and then that makes the perfect <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Romantic, but you know some people like it very sour then don't leave it longer. Oh, that's really not sourness comes from <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Exactly. You're reading acid.

Okay. I've put together my mise en blas things in place here and it came together really quick <time_token_6> <time_token_7> Started with two level cups of all-purpose flour <time_token_7> <time_token_8> You need about one and a half to two cups of milk <time_token_9> <time_token_10> I've got two tablespoons of butter that I'm gonna melt down on the microwave <time_token_10> <time_token_11> and a half teaspoon of kosher salt a couple of large eggs and <time_token_12> <time_token_12> This is two teaspoons of baking powder <time_token_13> <time_token_15> And a tablespoon of sugar which is optional then I'm gonna add a drop or two of vanilla <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Okay, first thing we're going to do is combine all of the dry ingredients <time_token_20> <time_token_20> Next we're going to beat two eggs into the milk <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Okay, now I'm gonna whisk in the melted butter and after I pull it out of the microwave <time_token_25> <time_token_26> I let it sit for a little bit. I don't want to put it in there piping hot <time_token_29> <time_token_29> Now we're gonna gently mix in <time_token_30> <time_token_32> The milk and egg to moisten the flour and don't worry if you have a few lumps in here <time_token_33> <time_token_33> That's about the consistency I like <time_token_34> <time_token_36> And then finally my little touch I like to do is just add a drop or two of vanilla extract <time_token_37> <time_token_37> Okay, I'm gonna put my burgers on about medium-high <time_token_38> <time_token_40> And I like this little flat top griddle that I have then you can use a regular <time_token_41> <time_token_42> We're gonna get that nice and preheated. Okay a good way to test to see if your griddle is hot enough <time_token_42> <time_token_43> You just take your hand <time_token_43> <time_token_45> You push them on there for a good. I don't know 10 seconds or so <time_token_45> <time_token_46> And if you remove your hand you got a nice red tint to it, it's ready just kidding <time_token_47> <time_token_47> Do a couple of water drops <time_token_47> <time_token_48> And as soon as those bubble off like that <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Your pan is hot and to season my griddle I like to use a little butter you can use <time_token_51> <time_token_51> pan spray or oil if you like <time_token_52> <time_token_53> I've got a high-tint spatula here. So what won't melt onto the <time_token_54> <time_token_55> We have about a third cup of <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Batter for each pancake <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Spread a little bit of that around <time_token_59> <time_token_59> Now at this point too you can add <time_token_60> <time_token_62> Different things to your pancake batter throw in some fresh blueberries chocolate chips <time_token_62> <time_token_63> You can tell your pancakes are starting to cook <time_token_64> <time_token_65> If I look in at these little bubbles on the edges <time_token_65> <time_token_66> So this is gonna be the first one. I'm gonna turn <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Come over here <time_token_71> <time_token_71> And once you flip them <time_token_72> <time_token_72> They only need <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Half the time on the other side <time_token_73> <time_token_75> All right after they're done.

That's oven proof and put them in <time_token_76> <time_token_77> to a warm oven anywhere between 180 to 200 degrees and <time_token_77> <time_token_79> Then you can serve up the whole family at once. Okay, I'm gonna keep it simple today <time_token_79> <time_token_79> Just do a little bit of butter on each one <time_token_82> <time_token_85> And drizzling fresh real maple syrup, I guess it's not fresh, but it's real <time_token_85> <time_token_86> Expensive stuff here, but it's <time_token_86> <time_token_89> Well, I just like to thank my daughter for finding this easy recipe.

Cops suck! <time_token_2> <time_token_2> Hey what's up guys? I'm Matty Matheson. We're here in Parkdale, Toronto. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> We're about to make some fucking pancakes. I love pancakes. You guys should love pancakes. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> Let's make some pancakes! <time_token_5> <time_token_5> What should I do? <time_token_5> <time_token_6> You've never had pancakes like this because these ones are going to be the best pancakes you've ever had. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> I make the best pancakes in the world. Try to fuck with me on this. You can too. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> Alright so to make pancakes, you need a few ingredients here. This is everything that you need to make a perfect pancake. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> You need flour. What's up? <time_token_9> <time_token_10> You got some buttermilk. If you don't have buttermilk, you can use just milk and then add some white vinegar to it just like a tablespoon. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> That'll sour it up for you. We need that baking soda, arm and hammer. <time_token_11> <time_token_13> And then we got some baking powder, that magic powder. Don't put it in your nose. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> Then we got Pam. We got the Greaselord, the OG. <time_token_13> <time_token_15> We got blueberries for blueberry pancakes, little bananas, some beautiful eggs at room temperature. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> We got some butter at room temperature. Last but not least, for pancakes in Canada at least. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> I know you guys are eating pancakes anywhere else. You need some maple syrup. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Last time I ate a pancake was about three weeks ago. I had a pancake at work. It was great. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> These are all the tools you need. You need a whisk, you need a spatula, you need a spoon or a ladle, a dirty ass strainer. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> Sifter. We're going to sift the dry ingredients. So first, you always got to remember you got to separate your dry and your wet ingredients, right guys? <time_token_22> <time_token_23> So first, we're going to start with two cups of flour. We're going to sift all of the ingredients. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> You got that trap house vibe, making the fish scale here, get the fish scale. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> You want the flour to be lumpy when you're making pancakes, but you don't want the starting base to be lumpy. <time_token_25> <time_token_28> Then we're going to add, I like my shits sugary, so I'm going to add some sugar. That was about like three tablespoons. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> So baking powder, you always need a little bit more than baking soda. Baking soda is like the crazy shit. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Baking powder is the stuff that will make it like fluffy. So we just need a little bit, like five key bumps of that. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> And then you got baking soda, just a little bit. And then we just sift that stuff in there. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Oh, also, when always baking, you always got to remember a little pinch of salt. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> And then we just sift that stuff. We got our flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, sugar. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> So there is your dry mix. Now, to make your wet mix, we're going to need some eggs. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> I need to melt some butter really quickly. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> This is what not to do. This pan is way too fucking hot. This butter is now brown butter. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Bush league move. You got to start again. You're a fucking idiot. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Okay, so now we got to start over because I fucked up that last shit. So take about this much butter. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> That's about like two tablespoons of butter. You don't want it to be brown. You want it to be nice and yellow. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> So to make really good pancakes, I'm going to separate the eggs with the yolks and the whites. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> To separate whites and yolks, you can just pour it back and forth and let the shell kind of cut off the egg yolks and whites. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> So for this amount of flour, we're going to need four eggs. See this yolk? See this yolk broke? That's no good. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> Okay, now check this out. We're going to take the egg whites. We're going to just stir them up. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Pretty much a whiskey sour down here. We're going to add some buttermilk. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> At home, you'll probably do about two cups, which is about that much. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Okay, so then we have our yolks. So we're just going to stir these guys up. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> So we're going to add a little bit of sugar. That's a lot of sugar. That's okay. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> So we're just going to stir this up. I should have got a smaller bowl to do this. Idiot. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> We're going to add some butter. So when you're pouring something warm like this into egg yolks or any kind of eggs and stuff, <time_token_55> <time_token_55> make sure it's not hot hot because it's going to just turn your shit into scrambled eggs. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> So there we go. So we had our egg yolks and our sugar and our butter, and then we had our egg whites with our buttermilk. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Then we combined those guys, and then we had all of our dry ingredients, and then we combined those and we stirred those in. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> Now we're just going to pour in the flour. The biggest way people fuck up pancakes is by overstirring pancakes. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> You don't want to become flat and dense. You want to just fold it in just enough to make them kind of fluffy. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> And those clumps of flour that you see that you think might be weird are really good because they'll make things fluffier when you're frying up the pancakes. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> I'm going to put this in the fridge for a little second. Let this kind of just sit and marinate. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> Okay. We're going to make classic just pancakes and maple syrup, and then we're also going to throw some blueberries in some, <time_token_65> <time_token_65> and we're going to throw some little bananas in some too. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> These bananas are cute, aren't they? And then you can just cut them up. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> Here we've got some nice local nature ripe blueberries. They're from Product in the USA. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> So we're going to use those guys. Let's start making some fucking pancakes. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> So you can kind of see it's kind of set up there. Now, Pam. <time_token_69> <time_token_71> So spray out the Pam. All you YouTube trolls probably going to comment on how much Pam I just put in the pan. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Fuck you. How about that? <time_token_71> <time_token_72> You don't want to press on them. You don't want to do anything. What you want to do is just let them sit there. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Your pancakes are cooking. Just chill out. Think about your woman. Think about your dude. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> Think about that special place you want to go with them. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> That's getting a little nice and brown here on the side. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> It's a perfect little pancake, isn't it? <time_token_75> <time_token_76> It is. Yes, it is, Matty. Yes, it is. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> We've got some cakes here, boys. Made with love. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> I'm Matty Matheson, and these are fucking pancakes. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> I flipped these guys once. They're pretty good. I'm going to take them off. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Got a short stack. This is called a short stack. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> The best pancakes in the world are right here on this plate. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> And now we're going to take some of Montreal's best maple syrup. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> So this is the OG pancake here. Then we're going to make some blueberry pancakes next. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> I hate when people make blueberry pancakes and they put like three fucking blueberries in it. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Let's just make a lot of blueberries in it. Fucking load it up. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> What's up? This is a blueberry pancake. It's the best one you've ever had. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> I just showed you how to do it. Don't fuck it up. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Don't tweet me about your ugly-ass pancakes. These are beautiful. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> I only want to see beautiful pancakes coming from you guys. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> You can make any kind of pancake. Throw some butter chicken roti in there. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Throw some jerk chicken, some McDonald's. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Banana blueberry pancakes. See how easy that is? <time_token_88> <time_token_88> It's a blank canvas. Do whatever you guys want. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Don't put your boogers in pancakes. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> No one wants to eat your fucking boogers. Perfect pancakes. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> What you know about them? I'm out. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> I'm going to let these camera dudes eat some of these perfect pancakes. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Eat some fucking pancakes. Pancakes. Eat some fucking pancakes. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Yeah? Good cakes? <time_token_92> <time_token_92> Oh, good cakes. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> They're actually amazing though. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> You should try some more. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> So all the ingredients I bought today to make all those pancakes, <time_token_94> <time_token_95> every single thing on that table today was $19.56. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> World hunger can be solved by $19.56. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> Everyone just needs to eat fucking pancakes. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> Once again, you're welcome world. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> We'll get you in the booth later.

<time_token_20> <time_token_22> Another problem people have is that they skimp on the milk and cream, so the potatoes end <time_token_22> <time_token_23> up all stiff. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> This is bad. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> You might think that using a food processor to mash your potatoes would be great because <time_token_26> <time_token_27> it's really quick. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> This is so wrong. <time_token_27> <time_token_29> It just turns them into this sort of sticky, pasty lump of glue. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> It is the worst thing you can do to a potato. <time_token_33> <time_token_36> Now I'm going to show you the right way to mash potatoes, the same way my mother showed <time_token_36> <time_token_38> The first thing you want to do is pick the starchy potato because it'll fall apart, and <time_token_38> <time_token_38> that's what you want. <time_token_38> <time_token_41> The starchiest potatoes are russets, and the next starchiest are Yukon Golds, and both <time_token_41> <time_token_41> are just fine. <time_token_41> <time_token_45> Next, you want to peel, rinse, and most important, cut your potatoes into nice, even chunks. <time_token_45> <time_token_47> That way they'll all cook at the same rate, and you won't get anywhere little nasty hard <time_token_47> <time_token_48> bits in your potato. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Next comes a crucial step. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> You want to cook these potatoes until they are falling apart. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> Put them in cold water and bring them to a boil because that starts to break them down <time_token_53> <time_token_54> more than if you just put them in boiling water. <time_token_54> <time_token_56> You want to salt the water because the salt starts to disintegrate the potatoes too. <time_token_56> <time_token_59> But the most important thing is that you really cook those potatoes about 25 minutes. <time_token_59> <time_token_62> After you bring them to a boil, let them simmer long and slow until the edges start to fall <time_token_62> <time_token_63> off and when you stick a knife in the middle, it just all falls apart. <time_token_64> <time_token_67> Drain the potatoes and then put them right back into that hot pot and start to dry them <time_token_67> <time_token_69> out over very low heat until they really start falling apart, turning white on the <time_token_69> <time_token_71> edges and practically turning into mashed potatoes right then and there in the pot. <time_token_71> <time_token_74> To finish the job, you can use a hand masher or you can use a ricer for super smooth silky <time_token_75> <time_token_77> So now it's time to finally add your cream or milk. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> You want to make sure it's warm so it doesn't cool down your potatoes, and the most important <time_token_79> <time_token_80> thing is you want to make sure you use lots. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> Don't worry, it can look like soup at first, but if you keep stirring, you'll see those <time_token_82> <time_token_84> potatoes just drink up all that cream. <time_token_84> <time_token_87> The final step for making great mashed potatoes is to add a few fresh herbs, chives are nice <time_token_87> <time_token_88> or maybe parsley, and some butter. <time_token_88> <time_token_91> If you've done all of these things right, you're going to have fluffy, creamy, silky <time_token_91> <time_token_94> smooth mashed potatoes that will make you so glad you made them and everybody at your <time_token_94> <time_token_95> table will feel the exact same way.

I'm peeling three good sized flowery potatoes <time_token_6> <time_token_8> there. And you want to half them. You're going to cook half if you've not already got some <time_token_8> <time_token_10> leftover mashed potato and you're going to go for the other five. So boil your kettle <time_token_10> <time_token_12> get them in there for fresh. Bring them to the boil. And while they're cooking away, <time_token_12> <time_token_14> grate the remaining half of the three potatoes. Give them a good rinse through to remove any <time_token_14> <time_token_19> starch. And they get a nice clean tea towel. Dip them out onto there. Fold the tea towel over and <time_token_19> <time_token_22> just give it a little wiggle and a press just to dry them off. Just like that. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> Move any large bits as well. Measure out about a quarter of a pint of whole milk and then just <time_token_25> <time_token_28> put a little bit aside because you're going to use that to mash your potatoes. Into the remainder <time_token_28> <time_token_30> you want to crack one free-range egg. You know how I like the pepper. Straight in there. Good for <time_token_30> <time_token_33> your twists. And a little bit of salt. A good whisk around with a fork. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> And then just put that to one side for a moment. Measure out about 50 grams of plain flour. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Get my nice little measuring device there. Tip out your grated potatoes into a bowl. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> You want to add one good teaspoon of baking powder. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> And then your flour. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> A quick little mix. <time_token_48> <time_token_51> Test your potatoes. Make sure they're cooked. Put your bacon on to cook. Don't cook it fully because <time_token_51> <time_token_52> you have to allow for extra cooking time and then put it into the oven to keep it warm. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> Then mash your potatoes. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> And add your cooked potatoes into your grated potatoes and flour mix <time_token_59> <time_token_60> together with your milk and egg mixture. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> I think that's a good mix together to get it all mixed incorporated. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> Now the reason I cook the bacon first is that it's always good to cook it in the pan that you've <time_token_66> <time_token_68> used to cook the bacon in. So put a knob of butter into a frying pan and then when that comes to <time_token_68> <time_token_70> a soft bubble you want to put in your dollops of boxy mixture in there. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> On a medium heat and cover. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> And then when the top looks like it's starting to set, that's when you can flip them over. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> If you tried before then you're likely to get quite a bit of a mess and they'll all break up on you. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> So cook them evenly on both sides. <time_token_81> <time_token_83> I like mine quite well done but that's down to preference. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> And then serve with some bacon and scrambled eggs. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> I usually have this on a Sunday morning for the taste test. <time_token_89> <time_token_92> Very hot, straight out of the pan.

They always say how do you get it so creamy and cheesy. So I'm gonna <time_token_3> <time_token_4> make some for the graduation party. I'm gonna show you how I make my creamy <time_token_4> <time_token_6> baked macaroni and cheese. Here's everything you'll need. You can also find <time_token_6> <time_token_8> this recipe on our website at YourHouseAhomeTV.com slash bake-macaroni. <time_token_8> <time_token_11> First you're gonna need cheese like a belbita and this is a 32-ounce and I'm <time_token_11> <time_token_14> gonna use about a third of this and I'm gonna use four cups of shredded. I like <time_token_14> <time_token_16> to use a Kobe Monterey Jack mix. This is a Mexican blend so that's about half of <time_token_16> <time_token_19> this 24 ounce bag. You're gonna need a can of evaporated milk and a can of water <time_token_19> <time_token_23> and 16 ounces of elbow macaroni and that's it. So let me show you how I put <time_token_23> <time_token_25> this together. This will make a pan about this size that feeds about eight to ten <time_token_25> <time_token_27> people. Start by bringing a large pot of water to boil then add a little salt to <time_token_27> <time_token_29> the water. Then you're gonna pour in your box of macaroni. Cook for about ten <time_token_29> <time_token_31> minutes on a medium to high heat. Stir occasionally. When it's done drain into <time_token_31> <time_token_34> a colander. Pour the macaroni into a baking pan or a baking dish and while <time_token_34> <time_token_35> that's still warm add one or two tablespoons of butter and a little bit <time_token_35> <time_token_38> of salt and mix it through to macaroni. Let that sit and cool while you make <time_token_38> <time_token_39> your cheese sauce. Before you start making your cheese sauce preheat your <time_token_39> <time_token_42> oven to 350. For the sauce in the same pot pour a can of evaporated milk then <time_token_42> <time_token_44> refill the can with water and pour that in and add 10 ounces of a Velveeta type <time_token_44> <time_token_47> cheese. Turn the heat on medium. Break up the cheese and stir occasionally as it <time_token_47> <time_token_49> starts to melt. After the cheese is melted and blended pour in two cups of <time_token_49> <time_token_51> Colby Jack shredded cheese. Stir for a few minutes then turn off the heat. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> Now that the macaroni is cool blend in one egg throughout the whole pan. Then <time_token_55> <time_token_60> pour in your cheese sauce and mix in well. If you need to you can add a little <time_token_60> <time_token_62> more water to make a creamier sauce. You really want to be able to see the sauce <time_token_62> <time_token_63> right below the top layer of the macaroni. After that's blended cover the <time_token_63> <time_token_67> top of the macaroni with the last two cups of shredded cheese. Then cover the <time_token_67> <time_token_70> pan with foil. Then bake at 350 for about 15 to 20 minutes. After 15 minutes check <time_token_70> <time_token_72> the pan. If the sauce is bubbling it should be ready. You want to take it out while the <time_token_72> <time_token_75> sauce is thick and creamy and the cheese is just melted on top. Nice and cheesy and creamy. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> So at the graduation party the macaroni was a hit. I made four pans of these and it all <time_token_78> <time_token_80> went really fast. Along with collard greens, barbecue chicken, barbecue ribs, baked beans, <time_token_80> <time_token_82> hamburgers, hot dogs, corn on the cob, shrimp and we even had a little lobster. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> So everyone had a great time inside.

<time_token_4> I'm Dave and tonight I'm going to show you how to make a version of my mother's tacos. <time_token_4> <time_token_4> I'll call them ground beef tacos. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> Now I'm making chicken tacos, fish tacos, steak tacos all the time. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> Ground beef is not really something I go to all that much but I tell you when I do I absolutely <time_token_7> <time_token_8> It brings me back to my childhood and it's a dish I absolutely love. <time_token_8> <time_token_8> I think you will too. <time_token_8> <time_token_8> Let's show you how to do it. <time_token_8> <time_token_10> Ok we're going to start our beef tacos by browning off our ground beef and I'm using <time_token_10> <time_token_12> a mixture of 20% lean and 90% lean or 93% lean and for no other reason that I like kind <time_token_12> <time_token_13> of the fat and some of the flavor in that fattier meat and I'm just going to lay it <time_token_13> <time_token_15> into my nice hot pan here and I'm just going to break it up and let it all cook down and <time_token_15> <time_token_16> while this happens I'm going to go ahead if you don't have your vegetables chopped <time_token_16> <time_token_16> up this is a great time to do it. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> You just want to move this around, let it cook for 2 or 3 minutes then give it a good <time_token_17> <time_token_18> stir and make sure it's getting cooked all the way around. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> Ok so after my meat has browned off I like to remove it with a slotted spoon. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> It's an easy way, there's a few different ways to take off the meat and separate it <time_token_21> <time_token_22> out from the fat and I don't need all that fat in the taco meat. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> So once I get this done I'm going to drain off most of it then we're going to come <time_token_23> <time_token_24> back and start sauteing off some vegetables. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> So I just drained off all my meat and most of the fat that was in the pan there. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> I left a little bit because I need to saute my vegetables. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> Now I'm throwing in a full chopped onion, a pepper, I have to be using a passillo pepper <time_token_28> <time_token_29> which is not all that hot, got a little bit of heat to it, you can use whatever you want <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Jalapenos are great, even red bell peppers, green bell peppers are quite nice. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> I'm just going to let these cook down over like medium, medium high heat, you want some <time_token_32> <time_token_33> salt and pepper in there and go until the onions become translucent and nice and soft. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> So once our pepper and onion is nicely cooked down, like I said soft and translucent we're <time_token_34> <time_token_35> going to add our spices. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Now my kind of lead spice is cumin in this dish and I use a good amount, remember we <time_token_36> <time_token_38> got all that ground beef to season and I think one of the keys here is to use the spices <time_token_38> <time_token_39> in the mostly dry pan here, get them toasted a little bit which really helps bring out <time_token_40> <time_token_41> So that was a couple tablespoons of cumin, couple maybe a tablespoon of chili powder, <time_token_41> <time_token_43> half a tablespoon of oregano and just a few dashes because mine is really hot of cayenne <time_token_43> <time_token_45> pepper and I'm just going to stir those in and let that, let the, like I said the spices <time_token_45> <time_token_47> toast, actually I'm going to add a little bit more, maybe go half again more, now that <time_token_47> <time_token_49> half a tablespoon of chili powder, another half tablespoon of cumin, let's add some salt, <time_token_49> <time_token_51> again we got to salt all that beef and some pepper and just let these go for about five <time_token_51> <time_token_51> minutes, less than five minutes, three or four minutes. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> Okay so I just got to finish adding my tomato paste and as that's going in you just want <time_token_53> <time_token_54> to give it a quick stir and just like the spices I like to allow that tomato paste to <time_token_54> <time_token_56> cook down for three or four minutes over medium heat and that kind of concentrates the flavor, <time_token_56> <time_token_57> deepens and darkens the flavors as well and it's going to end up getting you a better <time_token_57> <time_token_57> result on the taco meat. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> So I'm going to let that go, stir everyone so I'll make sure nothing's burning, nothing's <time_token_58> <time_token_59> sticking too badly and we'll come back when it's time to add the beef back. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> So after a few minutes I'm going to turn my heat back up then I'm going to add in <time_token_60> <time_token_62> that ground beef that we browned earlier and I'm just going to mix and stir everything <time_token_62> <time_token_63> together and get it incorporated. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Alright last couple ingredients, secret weapon, my mom's secret weapon, a little bit of ketchup, <time_token_64> <time_token_66> probably not the most traditional but adds a little bit of sweetness, a little bit of <time_token_66> <time_token_68> vinegar and tartness which is super nice, I'm going to add about a teaspoon, a tablespoon <time_token_68> <time_token_70> of honey and I'm going to add a couple nice, deepened tablespoons of your favorite salsa. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> We're going to mix all of this together and we're actually going to add in about a cup, <time_token_72> <time_token_72> maybe a cup and a half of water. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> Now most of that water is actually going to evaporate off as this cooks but I like to <time_token_74> <time_token_75> get it in there so that kind of all the spices and everything we've had in there has a fluid <time_token_75> <time_token_78> way to incorporate all the flavors that have been kind of brought together so far and once <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I get this fully mixed together I'm going to turn the heat to low, I'm going to put <time_token_79> <time_token_80> the cover back on, I'm just going to let this simmer on low heat for about 20 minutes. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> So after 15 or 20 minutes you want to pull the lid off, give it a quick stir, you want <time_token_81> <time_token_82> to give it a quick taste. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> For seasoning, this one I could use a little bit more salt, use a little bit more pepper <time_token_83> <time_token_85> and then you can let it go as is or you can serve it as is, it's totally good. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> If you want it a little drier just go ahead and cook it like another 10 minutes or so <time_token_86> <time_token_87> with the lid off and as you cook it more that water will evaporate. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> I think this is just fine and dandy, let's go ahead and serve it up. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Okay, let's go ahead and plate our tacos, ground beef, this is basically just like my <time_token_89> <time_token_90> mom used to make, probably like a lot of us used to have, probably not super traditional <time_token_90> <time_token_92> but absolutely super delicious, you know throw whatever toppings you want, I like maybe a <time_token_92> <time_token_94> little sour cream on mine, oops and then certainly a little cheese, a little bit of lettuce and <time_token_94> <time_token_95> you are good to go. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> I'll see you next time on No Recipe Required.

It's not a problem. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> All right, gentlemen. So our water is starting to get hot. It's not fully boiling yet. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> So before it boils, we want to just slowly, gently put our meat into the water like that. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> So now we have our boil. So we want to turn it down to a simmer. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> Let's say maybe a three, three and a half, depending on your stovetop, even a four. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> But just so it's got a nice simmer going and it's boiling off that water. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> You're going to notice all the slime from the beef coming to the top. See that? <time_token_47> <time_token_49> Before you do that, you want to mix all your spices and make sure they're completely in there once it's boiling. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> And then they're going to rise to the top again. <time_token_50> <time_token_53> When they rise to the top, you just want to scrape off the sludge, scrape off the sludge, scrape off the sludge. <time_token_54> <time_token_57> This meat's good for the tacos that we're going to make, but I'm also going to make some flautas or taquitos, filling in burritos and other things. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> It's good. You can make a big batch, put it in the fridge, store it away. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> What we're doing is we're infusing that beef with these juices, these flavored juices, <time_token_60> <time_token_62> and we're going to get this to reduce to where it becomes basically a thick sauce with the fat and the meat and the reduction and everything else. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Everything is going to come nicely together. When we shred it, it's going to be absolutely yummy. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> So far, we've been doing this for about, I'd say maybe 30 minutes. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> We're letting it slowly reduce. That flavor is still infusing that meat. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> It's a long process. If you don't have patience for cooking, you're probably not going to enjoy making this recipe. <time_token_68> <time_token_71> If you're one of those people like me who will take hours and hours to make something because the reward is so amazingly immense, then you'll do this, and you will enjoy it. <time_token_71> <time_token_74> But please, I can't stress this enough. Follow the way I say to do it with the ingredients I say, and then if you want to change something afterwards, go ahead, but at least try it the way I have it first. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> Nothing worse than saying, I'm going to cut a corner here and there and then saying, oh, it didn't turn out the way I wanted. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> Just do it the way it's written, and then if you like it, do it again. If you don't like it, change something. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> All right, so I'll see you in a bit. <time_token_79> <time_token_81> So we're into our process here. We've been doing it for about maybe an hour, hour and a half. <time_token_82> <time_token_86> I just covered it up for a little bit, but you don't really have to because the key is to get the reduction going and just take anything that's off the side here because that is your flavor and keep reducing. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> All right, gentlemen, now take a look. There you go. It's all done. Look at that juice. <time_token_90> <time_token_92> Look at how nice that looks, and use forks to break it up. It breaks up like that. Look at how simple that is. <time_token_92> <time_token_95> Done. This is your meat mixture. I like to keep the juice here because you want to keep it moist. You don't want it to dry out. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> Also, it will steam out a bit more, so this will get a little thicker.

Welcome to Eating with Rula. I'm Rula and today I'm going to share with you a delicious <time_token_4> <time_token_6> recipe from Penne ala Vodka. It's really easy and it's quick to make, it's really not that <time_token_6> <time_token_8> bad, and why don't we get started? So first thing you're going to need is Penne. It looks <time_token_8> <time_token_10> like this, in case anyone's not familiar with it, it looks like little tubes, and you're <time_token_10> <time_token_11> going to need to boil about three quarters of this box. So up to there I would say take, <time_token_11> <time_token_13> you know, a pot of boiling water with salt, boil this amount, and this is what it will <time_token_13> <time_token_15> end up looking like. And it's not like mushy, mushy, starchy. I cooked it till it was not <time_token_15> <time_token_17> exactly al dente, a little bit more, so it's a little bit hard, but not so starchy and mushy. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> So it's just the right texture. What you're going to need now is to begin is a half of <time_token_19> <time_token_21> a stick of butter. You're going to put that in there. You're going to melt that with one <time_token_22> <time_token_24> medium onion finely chopped. So I'm going to put that in there, and you're going to stir <time_token_25> <time_token_27> it occasionally for about five minutes. Okay, so it's been five minutes, and this is what <time_token_27> <time_token_29> our onions look like with the butter, our finely chopped onions. And, you know, they're <time_token_29> <time_token_30> not browned, but they look nice and soft and yellow. And now we're ready to add our next <time_token_30> <time_token_33> ingredient, which is a little bit less than one third of a cup of vodka. So any vodka <time_token_33> <time_token_35> you want to use, there you go. You're going to let that simmer for about four, five minutes. <time_token_36> <time_token_38> So now lower the heat and just let it simmer. Okay, so it's been four minutes, and as you <time_token_38> <time_token_40> can see, you would expect there to be a lot more liquid with the onions, but the vodka's <time_token_40> <time_token_42> pretty much all evaporated. This is like a lot of the butter that was up from before. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> And now we're going to add three quarters of a cup of tomato puree, not tomato paste <time_token_44> <time_token_46> and not tomato diced tomatoes, tomato puree to our recipe. And then we are also going <time_token_46> <time_token_48> to add one cup of heavy cream. Stir that in, all the ingredients together, and we're just <time_token_51> <time_token_53> going to let that simmer now for five minutes. This is so super easy. You know, you're throwing <time_token_53> <time_token_55> in all your ingredients. Basically all that it is is you're taking time for each group <time_token_55> <time_token_57> of ingredients to meld in with one another, and you add the next one, and then you're <time_token_57> <time_token_59> going to have this fantastic sauce in another few minutes. Wow, so as you can see, our sauce <time_token_59> <time_token_60> is now, it's been five minutes and I've let it simmer, stirring it every once in a while, <time_token_60> <time_token_62> and it's beautiful, beautiful red pink. So now you're going to have to add your final <time_token_62> <time_token_64> group of ingredients, a half a teaspoon of salt or more. I mean, it depends how salty <time_token_64> <time_token_66> you like your foods. It's all a matter of preference. A quarter teaspoon of black pepper <time_token_66> <time_token_68> or more, if you like, again. And then for the last ingredient, which is Tabasco, I'm <time_token_68> <time_token_70> going to add about three drops, but you can add more as much as you like. You can just, <time_token_70> <time_token_73> you know, put it in and then you try it and you see how it is. So I'm going to try it <time_token_73> <time_token_75> now for you guys just to see. Very good. But again, for those of you who like salt, you <time_token_76> <time_token_77> may like to have a lot more salt. Okay, so now I've got my pasta. It's cooked. I have <time_token_77> <time_token_79> my sauce. Everything is looking perfect here. I'm going to add my pasta to the sauce. And <time_token_79> <time_token_81> I am going to stir everything in together. And the reason I didn't make the whole box <time_token_84> <time_token_86> of pasta, and I only did three quarters of the box, is because I want there to be enough <time_token_86> <time_token_88> sauce for all of this penne here. And as you can see, it's looking good. So this is what <time_token_89> <time_token_91> our penne ala vodka looks like. Absolutely beautiful and perfect. And I'm sure it tastes <time_token_91> <time_token_93> that way too. Let's see. Mmm. Very good. I really hope that this is going to be the <time_token_94> <time_token_95> first time you enjoy it. And I hope you'll let me know what you think if you try it. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> And I hope to see you again on Eating with Rula. Bye-bye.

welcome to Mary Cooks. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> Would you believe I've been researching for over an hour and a half on one particular <time_token_3> <time_token_3> recipe that I want to do today? <time_token_3> <time_token_4> And this is a recipe that my mother taught me and my family all does. <time_token_4> <time_token_4> It's a traditional recipe in our family. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> It's pasta fagioli, which means beans in pasta, pasta in beans, and the Italian way <time_token_6> <time_token_6> of saying it is pasta e fagioli. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> I got on the internet, I got out all my favorite cookbooks, and I've been researching different <time_token_7> <time_token_8> recipes for pasta fagioli, and you wouldn't believe how many recipes there are, how many <time_token_8> <time_token_9> versions of this particular dish. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> So today what I'd like to do is I'd like to show you my mother's version of pasta fagioli. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> So let's get into the kitchen and let's get started. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> This recipe takes few ingredients, in fact it's a very inexpensive meal to make for the <time_token_12> <time_token_12> family, very economical at least in these times. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> I'd say probably it takes maybe about five ingredients. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> The main ingredients naturally are the two main ingredients are going to be our beans <time_token_14> <time_token_15> and our pasta, and the beans we're going to use are cannellini beans, a white kidney <time_token_15> <time_token_16> bean, and the pasta is a tiny little tube type pasta called ditalini. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> So that's our pasta and that's our beans. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> Then the other ingredients are crushed tomatoes, parsley, basil, an Italian, you always need <time_token_19> <time_token_20> your garlic, salt, and pepper, and our seasoning will be dry oregano, dry basil, and if you <time_token_20> <time_token_22> notice I buy large size basil and oregano since I use those so much in my cooking and <time_token_22> <time_token_22> that's another economical way of saving money by buying the larger sizes if you use it as <time_token_22> <time_token_23> much as I do. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> What we're going to do first, we're going to drain the beans, and let me explain something <time_token_23> <time_token_24> about the beans. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> This is one size can, this is 29.5 ounce can, this is another size can by another company, <time_token_26> <time_token_26> and this is 15.5 ounces. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> If you use the 15.5 ounces you'll need two cans, I'm just using one can of the 29.5 ounces. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> So we want to drain the beans, and we want to also rinse them, there's a lot of salt <time_token_30> <time_token_30> on the beans. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> Use some water to get the bottom out of there, and I'm going to let that drain, let that <time_token_32> <time_token_33> sit on the side, we're not going to use those until much later. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> I'm going to go ahead and start chopping up my spices, and we'll get back to you in <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Maybe I should put my glasses on when I'm giving you measurements and sizes. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> I made a mistake, this size can is 19 ounces, and it wasn't until after I drained them did <time_token_36> <time_token_37> I realize that's not going to be enough beans. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> So I would say two cans this size would be what you would want, since I only have this <time_token_38> <time_token_40> and the small one which is 15.5, I'm going to use that, but I would recommend the 19 <time_token_40> <time_token_40> ounces, which is a pound and three ounces, two cans of those. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> Let's start now making our sauce. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> So first we're going to coat the bottom of our sauce pan with some olive oil, I'd say <time_token_42> <time_token_43> probably that's a tablespoon of olive oil. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> Let that get hot, and I have that on medium high, I'm going to add two cloves of garlic <time_token_45> <time_token_45> which have been minced. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> So let's take the garlic until it's translucent, don't want it to get brown. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Let's start to get the fragrances coming out. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> Okay, that's fine. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Two cans of crushed Italian tomatoes, and I found this particular brand on sale. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Whenever I see Italian tomatoes, whole tomatoes or crushed tomatoes on sale, I stock up. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> So this is my first time using this particular brand, but it's crushed Italian tomatoes. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> Smell that garlic already. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> These are 28 ounce cans. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> Our salt, half a teaspoon of salt, I use kosher salt, or coarse sea salt. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Sometimes I'll use crushed black pepper, half a teaspoon. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> Let's do a teaspoon of dried oregano, and dried basil. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> Two tablespoons of chopped parsley, Italian parsley, black leaf parsley, and two tablespoons <time_token_66> <time_token_66> of fresh chopped basil. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Mix that through well. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> Get the sauce to start coming to a boil, and once it does, turn it down to low <time_token_69> <time_token_70> and let it simmer for about 15 to 20 minutes. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> We want the spices to blend in with the tomato sauce. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> So 15 to 20 minutes should do a good job of blending everything. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> Add crushed red pepper to this if you like, or chopped jalapeno pepper if you like your sauce hot. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> I like mine on the spicy side, so I'm going to add, oh, probably about half a teaspoon <time_token_75> <time_token_75> of crushed red pepper. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> While this is simmering, put a cover on, let that simmer 15 to 20 minutes. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> I'm going to stop my water boiling for my pasta. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> That's the ditalini pasta. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> This is a one pound box. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I'm going to use half of this, so we're going to use half a pound of ditalini pasta <time_token_79> <time_token_79> that we'll add to the sauce when it's ready. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> I've drained the macaroni, and I'm going to add it to the tomato sauce. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> That's half a pound of ditalini. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> Children love that shaped pasta. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> And now I'm going to add the white kidney beans. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Mix this through. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> The beans are cooked, and the pasta's cooked. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> So all we're going to do is just incorporate all of the flavorings together. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> Some pasta bajoli is very thin. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> It's very soupy. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> This is where this one is different. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> This is more like a stoop. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> You know how Rachael Ray says stoop for soup and a stew? <time_token_88> <time_token_88> This is more of a stew consistency. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> That's not very soupy. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Now we're going to let this cook, simmer it, I'd say, or cook it on low, <time_token_90> <time_token_91> for about another 10 minutes just to incorporate all of those seasonings <time_token_91> <time_token_91> into the beans and the pasta, and then we'll be ready to start cooking <time_token_91> <time_token_92> for about 10 minutes, and it's ready. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> Oh, that's great. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Now, as you can see, it's thicker than a soup, <time_token_93>

"asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_1> Hello, this is Chef John from foodwishes.com with macaroni salad. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> That's right, I cannot believe this many summers have come and gone and I have not shared my <time_token_2> <time_token_3> take on this iconic summer side dish. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> I mean I shudder to think what you've been using instead, no offense. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> So I apologize for the delay, but hopefully after you see and taste how awesome this comes <time_token_5> <time_token_5> out all will be forgiven. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> So let's go ahead and get started with the dressing. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> And one of the keys to a great macaroni salad is to do the dressing first. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> For reasons I'll explain in a second. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> So we're going to start with some mayonnaise. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> And of course we're going to use real full fat mayonnaise. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> And to the mayonnaise we'll add a couple spoons of Dijon mustard. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> To be honest the yellow mustard seems to be more traditional, but I really do like the <time_token_10> <time_token_10> Dijon better here. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> So a little bit of mustard. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> And then we're also going to need some vinegar. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> And for this I'm recommending plain white distilled vinegar. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> And it's not like you're going to wreck this using a different vinegar, but really this <time_token_12> <time_token_12> is just in here for the acidity. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> And I think we want something that has a neutral flavor. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> And then we'll need to season this up a little bit. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> With a shake of cayenne pepper. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> As well as some freshly ground black pepper. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> And of course some salt. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> And we'll take a whisk and we'll mix that up. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> And that is basically the base of the dressing for this macaroni salad. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Except for one key crucial and controversial ingredient, sugar. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> So while it is true that your classic American deli style macaroni salad does use sort of <time_token_19> <time_token_20> a sweet dressing, I find that the most popular recipes out there call for way, way too much. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Like a half a cup or two thirds of a cup of sugar. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> So I'm only going to call for one or two tablespoons. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Which I think provides plenty of sweetness, especially since we're going to add lots of <time_token_22> <time_token_23> And once that's all mixed together the liquid portion of our dressing is done. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> And we have to move on to the solids. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Also known as our diced veggies. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> So we'll start with a whole bunch of finely diced celery. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> As well as some grated carrot. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> And then we want a little bit of onion in this. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> And I'm going to use the white and light green parts of some scallions. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> But just regular onion will work fine. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> And then for color, sweetness and a little bitterness, we're definitely going to do some <time_token_27> <time_token_28> And I'm going to use several kinds. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> I'm going to go with some red bell pepper. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> And then also some green pepper in the form of poblano and jalapeno. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> And then we'll take a spatula and we'll mix this up. <time_token_30> <time_token_30> And I really think it's important we do this step before we cook our pasta, okay? <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Because these vegetables are almost going to get like a quick pickling in this dressing. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Okay, the salt, the sugar, the acid is going to pull liquid out of those vegetables. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> It's going to sort of firm up and crisp up the texture. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> And I really do think it makes a little bit of a difference. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> And besides, no one can really prove otherwise. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> And once that's mixed, we'll just pop that in the fridge while we prepare our macaroni. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> And I'm just going to leave that spatula right in there because we are going to use that <time_token_36> <time_token_36> to mix the salad up. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> So we'll pop that in the fridge and move on to our elbow macaroni. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> So what we have here is one pound of elbow macaroni. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> That's about four cups. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> And we are going to cook this in some generously salted boiling water. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> And I said cook, not undercook. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> We're going to cook this all the way, just like as if we were going to eat this hot. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> I don't have any idea who came up with the notion that you're supposed to undercook pasta <time_token_40> <time_token_40> for a salad. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> But it's just not true, unless you want a horrible gummy texture macaroni salad. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> I mean, who knows? <time_token_42> <time_token_42> Maybe you do. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> But assuming you want an enjoyable texture, I recommend cooking it the full time, at which <time_token_43> <time_token_43> point we're going to drain that very, very well. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> So let's pour that into a colander to let it drain. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> And do not, under any circumstances, rinse this pasta. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> For this particular salad, that is the biggest mistake you could make. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> So don't do it. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> Just let this sit and drain for about five minutes. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> And every so often, I want you to give it the old shake-a-shake-a, which is going to <time_token_47> <time_token_48> help knock off some of that water. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> And once we're convinced our macaroni is very, very well drained, we will transfer that into <time_token_49> <time_token_50> a large mixing bowl and proceed with probably the most important step of this whole process, <time_token_50> <time_token_50> the tossing and cooling of the macaroni. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> What we'll do is we'll take our spatula from the dressing, and we'll use that to toss this <time_token_51> <time_token_52> macaroni occasionally until it cools down to just about room temp. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> And while we're using the spatula from the dressing, we're definitely not going to add <time_token_53> <time_token_53> any dressing until this has cooled down. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Alright, if you had a mayonnaise-based dressing to hot macaroni, what you'll end up with is <time_token_54> <time_token_55> a very greasy macaroni salad. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> And what's going to happen here is you're tossing and cooling, a very fine layer of starch <time_token_56> <time_token_57> is going to form on each one of those pieces of macaroni, and that thin layer of starch <time_token_57> <time_token_58> has been proven to more effectively grab on and hold on to that mayonnaise-based dressing. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> It's true, they've done studies where? <time_token_59> <time_token_59> The Mayo Clinic. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> But anyway, like I said, we want to cool that down to about room temperature. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> And if everything's gone according to plan, those pieces of macaroni should just be tacky <time_token_61> <time_token_61> enough to stick to your hand. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> So that's perfect right there. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> And yes, I will stop touching the macaroni now. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> And at this point, finally, we can go ahead and add our dressing. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> And as you're mixing this, if you're thinking, man, this is way too much dressing, seems <time_token_64> <time_token_65> kind of wet, don't worry. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Because you prepped your macaroni properly, by the time this is ready to serve, it's going <time_token_66> <time_token_66> to be fully and perfectly absorbed. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> And by the way, we're not going to taste it at this point. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Okay, we don't want to season this until that macaroni has fully absorbed the dressing and <time_token_68> <time_token_68> it's at the temperature we're going to serve it. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> So what we'll do is we'll wrap it up and we'll pop it in the fridge for at least four hours, <time_token_69> <time_token_70> but overnight is best. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> Which is how long I left mine in the fridge. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> And then the next day when we pull it out, it should look something like this. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> And as predicted, all our dressing has been perfectly absorbed. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> What I like to do at this point is take the spatula and give it a nice mix so we can really <time_token_73> <time_token_73> see what we have. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> And while you can definitely serve it like this, I generally like to freshen it up a <time_token_74> <time_token_75> little bit with another small spoon of mayonnaise and just a little touch of cold water. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Just like a tablespoon or two, just drizzle it in and we'll give that a mix. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> And while that's really not going to significantly change the characteristics of the salad, <time_token_77> <time_token_78> it is like I said going to give it a little bit of a fresher look. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> So you decide. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> You are the Tony, Tony, Tony of your macaroni. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> So that kind of stuff's up to you. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> And then once our salad has been tossed and freshened up, the last and most important <time_token_80> <time_token_80> step we have to taste for seasoning. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> So I gave mine a taste and it was perfect and at that point we'll transfer it to some <time_token_82> <time_token_82> kind of serving container. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> And by the way, because this salad is so naturally beautiful and fresh looking, it does not need <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Unless of course you want people to share it on social media, which in that case you <time_token_84> <time_token_84> better top it with some green onions. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> You think someone's going to pin this with no garnish on top? <time_token_85> <time_token_85> I don't think so. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> So I did a little green onion for the final touch and that's it. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> My take on the classic all-American macaroni salad is done. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> And I realize taste is subjective, but for me this is just the epitome of the classic <time_token_88> <time_token_88> American macaroni salad. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Slightly but not too sweet with just the right level of acidity and a very generous amount <time_token_89> <time_token_90> of vegetables, as well as a beautiful silky creamy mouthfeel because we didn't dress <time_token_90> <time_token_91> that macaroni hot. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> But anyway, that's it. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> My version of the classic American macaroni salad. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> And of course this is going to pair beautifully with anything you barbecue, grill or smoke <time_token_93> <time_token_93> I probably should have done that in a different order. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> But anyway, the point is, I really hope you give this a try soon. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> So head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual. <time_token_95>

<time_token_33> Some chili pepper. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> And a little bit of cayenne. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Let's see where we're at here. <time_token_35> <time_token_35> Like I said before, <time_token_36> <time_token_37> we're really not looking to cook these too much. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> We're just trying to take the raw off it. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> All right, when I say culinary warhorse, <time_token_39> <time_token_40> I mean it, man. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Meatloaf is coming gone on restaurant menus <time_token_41> <time_token_41> over the last 40 years. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> A little bit of barbecue. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> I can't call it a barbecue meatloaf <time_token_42> <time_token_43> without a little bit of barbecue. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Don't want to forget that. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> So everybody's got their own version of it. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> You probably grew up on it or had it growing up. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> What I want to do before we do anything <time_token_46> <time_token_47> is taste this meat. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Very important because we're going to load this up <time_token_48> <time_token_49> and you don't want to come back an hour later <time_token_49> <time_token_49> and find out your meatloaf wasn't seasoned properly. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> You know, we make our homemade sausage at the restaurant. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> What was the guy who piped without tasting? <time_token_51> <time_token_51> You know what? <time_token_51> <time_token_52> I'm going to wash my hands real quick. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> All right, let me taste this. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> I'm going with that. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Season properly, salted correctly. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> This is not the fun part. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Put it right in this loaf pan. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Let's get rid of this. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> And then we're just going to give it the final treatment. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> And that's just a little bit of barbecue sauce over the top. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> And we're going to bake this at 350 <time_token_64> <time_token_65> for about an hour, hour and 15 minutes. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> You want this around 150, 155. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> I hate overcooking meatloaf. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> So think of a meatloaf as a burger. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Between 150 and 160, you're approaching well, <time_token_68> <time_token_69> medium well, well. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> So why would you overcook your meatloaf? <time_token_69> <time_token_70> So 150, you're good. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> But if you're a little skittish, go a little longer. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> But it's not going to be as moist. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> So I'm going to put this in. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> Just a little bit more barbecue sauce. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Just a light glazing on the top just to give it a nice shine. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> This looks really good. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> I'm going to cut it. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> See what this looks like. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Nothing wrong with that. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> It's got the full barbecue treatment. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> That's the dish, barbecue meatloaf.

So if I added it later, it's gonna make it more fresher the flavor of the lemongrass <time_token_47> <time_token_48> And then you can add in the fish sauce <time_token_49> <time_token_50> If you like more sweet you cannot add more sugar, but here I have only three tablespoon of sugar <time_token_50> <time_token_51> It's perfectly for the pot that I cook today with a cup of water <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Finally the chicken powder <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Like I said if you want more sweet more salty just add a little more fish sauce and the sugar only <time_token_54> <time_token_54> and here's the <time_token_54> <time_token_54> chili pepper crushed <time_token_55> <time_token_55> Or flax as a lot of people call it <time_token_55> <time_token_57> You can add more if you like more spiciness, but I think this is good amount of spice for the soup <time_token_57> <time_token_57> Okay, just pour them all in <time_token_58> <time_token_59> And right now this is a good time for you just to chase a little bit of it <time_token_60> <time_token_61> This is the final step in cooking the soup <time_token_61> <time_token_62> We're gonna put all the vegetable in here <time_token_62> <time_token_62> I have cabbage and again, you can use bean sprout or <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Carriage or mushroom or any vegetable you prefer <time_token_63> <time_token_65> Okay, I'm gonna cook it about two or three more minutes or until it's a little bit tender not too too tender <time_token_65> <time_token_66> I like it stay crunchy and now we're gonna prepare the <time_token_66> <time_token_68> Herbs I'm gonna cut the cilantro in little slice a thinly slice put it aside <time_token_68> <time_token_68> And with the lime <time_token_69> <time_token_69> We can start to go ahead and cut the line in <time_token_70> <time_token_70> Half or you can cut it in little pieces <time_token_70> <time_token_71> If you want, I just want to prepare the juice ahead of time. So I don't have to squeeze it in every time I need it <time_token_72> <time_token_74> See this this is my lime chooser. It's very cute. I use it a lot. It got a lot of juice out from <time_token_74> <time_token_75> And before we begin I like to tell show you how to pick a good line <time_token_75> <time_token_76> We want to pick the one with the shiny skin <time_token_76> <time_token_76> You see that how shiny and thin it is. You get a lot of juice from it <time_token_76> <time_token_77> You don't want the one that's dry and then kind of <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Bumpy, okay, so just squeeze it all out <time_token_79> <time_token_80> After we finish you can put it aside <time_token_80> <time_token_81> In a bowl for later serving like I said, you can cut the lime in wedges if you like <time_token_81> <time_token_82> This is just more convenient. Okay. So now we're gonna get ready to scoop out the meat and <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Ready to eat <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Now with the lime add as much as you like it depends how sour you want it <time_token_95> <time_token_96> It's supposed to be sweet sour a little bit salty.

That's why I'm wearing white to make <time_token_0> <time_token_1> spaghetti and meatballs. Now you could spend all day making sauce or you could <time_token_1> <time_token_2> do it my quick and easy way and make the sauce and the spaghetti and the meatballs <time_token_2> <time_token_2> all in 35 minutes. And here's how. We're going to start by preparing some soft <time_token_2> <time_token_3> fresh breadcrumbs for the meatballs. So I have two slices of my homemade whole <time_token_3> <time_token_3> wheat bread which is soft. You can use white bread or a soft whole wheat but it <time_token_3> <time_token_4> has to be soft like this. Okay? So we're going to put that in a food processor <time_token_4> <time_token_5> and we're going to process what they call fresh breadcrumbs. Do not use dried <time_token_5> <time_token_6> breadcrumbs because it has to be fresh breadcrumbs. So we'll process it for about <time_token_6> <time_token_7> 10 seconds and that's how you make fresh breadcrumbs. So it's about three-quarters <time_token_7> <time_token_7> of a cup of crumbs and two slices like that will do it. So we put those crumbs <time_token_7> <time_token_8> into a bowl. Okay? Put this back. And to the breadcrumbs we're going to add a <time_token_8> <time_token_9> third cup of milk. Now I'm using 1% milk. You can use whole milk if you want but <time_token_9> <time_token_9> I'll just use it to keep the calories down. So I'm going to stir it up just a <time_token_9> <time_token_10> little bit with a fork. Kind of get it all in there. And while that absorbs this <time_token_10> <time_token_11> milk, while the bread absorbs the milk, we're going to go on and make the sauce. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> Okay? Now what I do is I like to have a smooth sauce. I'm going to use the same <time_token_11> <time_token_12> food processor. If you don't have a food processor, you can cut the bread into <time_token_12> <time_token_13> tiny little pieces and do the same thing and you can puree the tomatoes in a <time_token_13> <time_token_13> blender. But I'm going to use the same food processor. I'm using a 28, 28 ounce <time_token_13> <time_token_14> can of plum tomatoes. They make the best tasting sauce. I like it kind of smooth <time_token_14> <time_token_14> so I'm going to puree the tomatoes first. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> All right, that's been maybe 20 seconds and I think that's good to go. Okay? All <time_token_16> <time_token_16> right. So I started my burner going. Now let me just tell you about the, or my pot <time_token_16> <time_token_17> going. Let me tell you about the pot. You do need a pot that's at least seven <time_token_17> <time_token_17> inches across the bottom. So measure the bottom of your pot. It has to be seven <time_token_17> <time_token_18> inches across because you have to fit all the meatballs in there in one layer. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> So all right. So now we're going to make the sauce while the breadcrumbs soak <time_token_19> <time_token_19> and we're going to saute one clove of garlic, which I have in here. See that I <time_token_19> <time_token_20> already pressed it, in a tablespoon of olive oil. So I'm going to put the olive <time_token_20> <time_token_21> oil in here. All approximate. It's just sauce, you know, but a tablespoon. But the <time_token_21> <time_token_21> reason that you want to use a generous amount of oil is because the oil helps <time_token_21> <time_token_22> the lycopene in the tomatoes absorb better into your system. It's a good <time_token_22> <time_token_23> cancer protector. Okay. See the garlic is kind of gold now. That's the perfect <time_token_23> <time_token_23> time to add the tomato. So there it's, it's been about maybe one full minute. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> Now we're going to add the tomatoes. Okay. All right. So that's it. Tomatoes are in. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Now we're going to add a few more ingredients and let this cook. Here's <time_token_26> <time_token_26> what we're going to add. We're adding a half, here's this right here. It's a half <time_token_26> <time_token_27> teaspoon of Italian spice, like a combination of Italian seasonings, a half <time_token_27> <time_token_28> teaspoon, two teaspoons of sugar, a quarter teaspoon of salt. They're going to go in <time_token_28> <time_token_28> here. Okay. And some fresh pepper to taste and well you got to do the fresh <time_token_28> <time_token_29> pepper. Okay. All right. We'll stir that up. It's still bubbling so we're just <time_token_29> <time_token_30> going to let it cook away here and we're going to add some fresh basil, but we're <time_token_30> <time_token_31> not going to do it till the very last minute. Oh, fresh basil. Fantastic. All <time_token_31> <time_token_32> right. So we'll turn it down just a little, let it simmer over here while we put <time_token_32> <time_token_32> together the meatballs. Okay. Now we have the, the three quarters of a cup of soft <time_token_32> <time_token_33> fresh bread crumbs. They've soaked in all that nice milk. Now we're going to add <time_token_33> <time_token_34> all of these ingredients here. First of all, it's an egg. One egg gets added and <time_token_34> <time_token_34> then here's all the rest of the stuff. Very easy. It's a tablespoon of fresh <time_token_34> <time_token_35> parsley, a tablespoon of parmesan, a tablespoon each. It's a half teaspoon of <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Italian spice, the same one that went into the sauce, a clove of garlic, and a <time_token_36> <time_token_37> quarter teaspoon of salt. Okay. And of course some fresh pepper to taste. Okay. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> All right. So that's all the flavoring for the meatballs. We're going to, you have <time_token_38> <time_token_38> to stir this before you add the meat. Okay. Because it's, it's much better, it's <time_token_38> <time_token_39> much better way to incorporate all these flavors and everything so it's mixed in <time_token_39> <time_token_40> evenly. So there. That's it. Okay. Now we're going to add a three quarters of a <time_token_40> <time_token_41> pound of ground beef and here it is right here. That goes in. Okay. Simple. Now <time_token_41> <time_token_42> we're going to make some meatballs. Now I'd like to use gloves but, you know, I <time_token_42> <time_token_43> forgot my gloves again. I don't know how that happens. Every time I make a video <time_token_43> <time_token_43> I forget my gloves. Anybody? Anybody? <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Thank you. Thank you. Okay. You can do this by hand. I do it because I don't <time_token_45> <time_token_46> want to keep soaking my hands in water and drying them out but just easier. Okay. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> So now we're going to combine all this. Sauce is bubbling nicely. We're going to <time_token_47> <time_token_47> combine all this. You have to do it by hand and don't overdo it. You just kind <time_token_47> <time_token_48> of fold underneath and like that and just kind of squeeze it until you see it. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> That's fairly well incorporated. And I'm going to show you my trick for this, this <time_token_49> <time_token_50> recipe serves four people two meatballs each. So we're going to be making eight <time_token_50> <time_token_51> meatballs. Okay. Here's my little trick. You take the mixture once it's all mixed <time_token_51> <time_token_52> up like that. That looks pretty good. Okay. And in the bowl I kind of divide it in <time_token_52> <time_token_53> half like this. Okay. And then I divide it in half again. It's not perfect but it <time_token_53> <time_token_54> gives you a rough idea of how much you can use in each one. So each one of these <time_token_54> <time_token_54> sections is going to make two meatballs. Okay. So you just make the meatballs and <time_token_54> <time_token_55> these are about two inches across and what I do is I put the meatballs on a <time_token_55> <time_token_56> plate or something and I want to dump them all in the sauce at the same time. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> So there's one, about a two inch, two inches. So you shape all the meatballs <time_token_57> <time_token_57> first and then we're going to drop them into the sauce. And there's <time_token_57> <time_token_58> two reasons why these meatballs are so soft. One is because we're using a fresh <time_token_58> <time_token_58> breadcrumbs and not dried and the other is because they're going to cook in the <time_token_58> <time_token_59> sauce and that just makes them taste better and makes them super, super soft. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Okay. So let me finish up these eight meatballs and we'll put them in the sauce. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Okay. Last meatball. Here it is. Didn't take very long. Now here's my eight <time_token_61> <time_token_62> meatballs. As you can see they're not perfect but I consider meatballs like <time_token_62> <time_token_63> people. They're not all perfect. So but they're close enough in shape. So now <time_token_63> <time_token_63> we're going to drop them. I'm going to give the sauce a little stir here and we drop them <time_token_63> <time_token_64> into the sauce and that's it. Okay. Now that's why you need that seven inch sauce <time_token_64> <time_token_65> pan to make sure that these get all underneath the sauce and then the sauce <time_token_65> <time_token_65> level is going to come up as the meatballs go in. So there's one, two, three, <time_token_65> <time_token_67> kind of gently four, five, six, seven, eight. Okay. Now if they're not completely <time_token_67> <time_token_68> covered you can just kind of tap them a little bit and now this cooks for 20 <time_token_68> <time_token_69> minutes and while those are, that's it. We're just going to add the basil at the <time_token_69> <time_token_69> end while that's cooking. We make the spaghetti and we're done. Less than 35 <time_token_69> <time_token_70> minutes. So the meatballs have been cooking now for about 10 minutes. The <time_token_70> <time_token_71> water's boiling. Time to cook the spaghetti. Now the package says two <time_token_71> <time_token_72> ounces per person. What? If you're five? Three ounces just for me. All right. The <time_token_72> <time_token_72> sauce is done. Look. Just look at this. The meatballs are done. The sauce is done. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> It's nice and thick. Look at that. Here. There's one more thing to do though and <time_token_73> <time_token_74> this is really important. Fresh basil. You have to add at least two tablespoons <time_token_74> <time_token_74> of fresh basil. You just kind of slice it into little strips or pieces. It <time_token_74> <time_token_75> doesn't even matter but this smells amazing. You just, this is so key. I think <time_token_75> <time_token_76> that's about two tablespoons. Fresh basil is key. There's nothing like this smell <time_token_76> <time_token_77> but you have to do it last minute because you don't want to cook too much. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> So we'll stir in the basil. Oh it smells amazing. You got to come over. Okay. That's <time_token_78> <time_token_79> it. You just stir that in fresh. The spaghetti's done. Turn that off. We're <time_token_79> <time_token_79> going to drain the spaghetti. All right I'll put it back in here and the best <time_token_79> <time_token_80> way I find is to stir a little sauce into the spaghetti first so it has red <time_token_80> <time_token_81> all through it. Just a little bit of sauce like that and tongs are a good way <time_token_81> <time_token_82> to kind of stir the sauce into it. So it's all covered in red. Okay so there's <time_token_82> <time_token_83> my three ounce serving. That's not that much. Come on. Okay. Now to serve it you <time_token_83> <time_token_84> got your spaghetti. You put your two meatballs on top. A little more sauce <time_token_84> <time_token_85> with that amazing basil. Look at that. Ah. Okay. Now of course if you're like me <time_token_85> <time_token_86> there's still one more thing to do. A little bit of fresh parmesan. Okay. A little <time_token_86> <time_token_86> fresh parm. Oh my god. The spaghetti and meatballs is just the best thing in the <time_token_86> <time_token_87> world. All right so now there is a proper way to eat spaghetti. Okay. You're supposed <time_token_87> <time_token_88> to use a spoon and a fork and you go in and you kind of use the spoon and you <time_token_88> <time_token_89> twirl like that to get a nice little one bite right like that. Which is fine if <time_token_89> <time_token_90> you're dining with the royal family. But then there's my way. And my way is you <time_token_90> <time_token_91> take the fork and you just twirl and twirl and twirl and shove it in. It's a time saver. <time_token_91> <time_token_93> Awesome. There are a lot of fancy ways to make garlic bread but I like to keep it simple. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> A good loaf of bread. Lots of fresh garlic and a simple easy recipe and this one is <time_token_94> <time_token_94> really really easy. Pizza is really about the crust. It's not just a little bit of <time_token_95> <time_token_95> butter. It's a little bit of cheese. It's a little bit of cumin. It's a little bit <time_token_95> <time_token_96> of a cheese. Really good. And it's also really, really good. A little bit of <time_token_96> <time_token_96> cheese is really about the crust, isn't it? Especially pan pizza. So how would you <time_token_96> <time_token_97> like to make the most amazing pan pizza and the easiest? No rolling, no kneading, no work <time_token_97> <time_token_97> and you get this beautiful golden crispy crust.

It's a national dish and one of Korea's best <time_token_1> <time_token_2> love exports but surprisingly busy to make. So today we're going to use a feather blade <time_token_2> <time_token_3> steak or you can also use skirt. These are relatively cheap cuts that Korean people use <time_token_3> <time_token_4> because the soy marinade that we're going to make to make beef bulgogi overpowers the <time_token_4> <time_token_4> flavour of the beef so you don't need to waste your money buying expensive celery for this <time_token_4> <time_token_5> dish. And for the marinade all you need, it's relatively easy, is spring onion, finely <time_token_5> <time_token_7> chopped spring onion, finely chopped almonds, garlic, a touch of sugar and pear, salt, pepper, <time_token_7> <time_token_8> sesame oil and soy sauce. So now we're going to make the marinade starting with three tablespoons <time_token_8> <time_token_10> of soy sauce. One, two, three. About one and a half tablespoons of sesame oil, Korean <time_token_10> <time_token_13> sesame oil, very very full flavour. So one, there we go. And then if we use some sugar, <time_token_13> <time_token_14> so about the same, so one and a half tablespoons of sugar, mix that around. Spring onion, finely <time_token_14> <time_token_15> chopped. I tend to use quite a lot of this but maybe two tablespoons or something like <time_token_15> <time_token_16> that, frozen into the bowl, mix it around. And then, I mean Koreans go heavy on the garlic <time_token_16> <time_token_17> but maybe for Westerners might want to use it up but this is quite a lot of garlic so <time_token_17> <time_token_19> it's about one or two full tablespoons. And then, what we're going to do is we're going <time_token_19> <time_token_20> to grate two pears. I tend to like my world over being quite sweet. A lot of Koreans also use pear <time_token_20> <time_token_21> juice or apple juice. I prefer to use fresh pear because I like using fresh pears but also I like <time_token_21> <time_token_22> using it because pear actually breaks down the enzymes in meat and makes it softer. So then you <time_token_22> <time_token_23> get a really kind of, quite a gourmet kind of flavour coming from beef. You just grate that all in. <time_token_24> <time_token_28> There we go. We'll make it really nice and sweet. We'll just mix that around. And now, we've got the beef. So the beef, we lay out onto the <time_token_28> <time_token_32> chopping board. It's actually best to cut it into kind of, if you cut against the grain, again, that will make it much more tender. So always remember to cut against the grain into small, thin slices which are long, long slices against the grain. <time_token_34> <time_token_38> So, I've cut up all the beef. We're nearly good to go but I'm just going to have a last taste of this marinade and see if it needs anything else. Mmm, that's really nice. But I think it needs a touch more so you haven't added any pepper yet. So again, if we just add about two teaspoons, maybe even less. There we go. <time_token_38> <time_token_43> Try that. Mmm, perfect. Right. So we've got the beef. Mix it all around. Good distribution. And then it can be best to marinade it in a flat surface. So we're going to put the beef in this container. I marinade it for up to an hour in the fridge and actually <time_token_43> <time_token_48> less time when it's in room temperature. You only probably need about 30 minutes or so. But obviously, if you want to marinade it for longer, you know, one or two hours is absolutely fine too. So we'll just put that in the fridge for an hour and then we're going to cook it. So while we're waiting for the beef to finish marinating, we're going to cut up an onion. So if we chop it into half, then it's called, er, <time_token_48> <time_token_52> into a kind of half moon. And then we slice it extremely thinly like this. And then we will fry it with the beef. So it just adds that little bit more depth of flavour. Now what we're going to do is the beef's finished marinating. So we're going to fry it. And then we're also going to fry the onions that we just chopped. They actually go on top of the beef when we serve it. So we do cook them separately. I'm just going to cook the onion first. <time_token_53> <time_token_57> So if you just use a little rapeseed oil, a vegetable, put it in a pan. Let it heat up. And we're going to fry the onions until, until they go turned transparent. So just add that little bit of sweetness and loyalty and texture. And here we go. The oil's warmed up. Put those onions in there. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> And I've got a low, medium heat, so we don't mind them getting to brown, burnt. The onions I always fry, the more thyme you take, the sweeter, the more sweetness comes out of the flavour. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> So while that's cooking, let's turn our attention to the beef. So let's heat up the pan. <time_token_64> <time_token_67> Again, a little bit of vegetable oil, rapeseed oil in this case, rapeseed oil also works very well. There's some unflavoured oil, so it doesn't spoil or mar any of the original flavours of the fish we're trying to cook. <time_token_67> <time_token_71> Just get another wooden spoon. Move that oil around. And heat it up. Now, here we've got our beef, nicely marinated. And I guess the thing to do is not to cook this all in one boat. We're going to cook it bit by bit. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> So the oil is heated up. Lay it out evenly. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Just going to get a plate. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Let's see how our onions are going along nicely. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> Mix it around. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> Add more beef. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> Now we'll see the final product. This is great served with rice, great served with chemistry, great served with any kind of Korean pickles, which are all heavily chillied. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> And also, you can also serve this bulgogi with a kind of chilli paste, which can also be made at home, called sundang. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> But I just like to enjoy it as it is, for your favour. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> So, it's coming along nicely. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> What we don't want to do is overcook this. <time_token_90> <time_token_92> It's obviously that nice 10 degree that's been softened and made tender by the pear. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> Check on the onion quickly. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> So I think this batch is ready to go. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Put that on a plate. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Here is beef bulgogi. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> If you just serve it on a plate, put the fried onions on top and then maybe a little bit of spring onion. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> And if you're really going out to town, also a little bit of sesame seeds just for decoration. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> Enjoy with rice, kimchi and a nice cool glass of beer.

Add in your beaten egg and half of your milk stirring it initially and <time_token_48> <time_token_51> then add the rest of it and continue to stir until you have a lovely smooth batter. Now <time_token_51> <time_token_53> to make sure my batter was nice and clingy kind of like an ex boyfriend or girlfriend <time_token_53> <time_token_56> that just cannot let go I transferred my batter into a jug and then placed it in the fridge <time_token_56> <time_token_58> while I got on heating up my oil so over a medium flame on a hob I whacked down my pan <time_token_58> <time_token_60> and filled it with a load of vegetable oil getting it up to temperature. With the oil <time_token_60> <time_token_63> in the pan nice and hot I found it super easy to grab a nice tall glass, stick my sausage <time_token_63> <time_token_65> in it, I know that sounds wrong we will just skip over that bit, pour in the chilled batter <time_token_65> <time_token_67> and then any excess at the top it did not make I will just spoon that extra batter on <time_token_67> <time_token_70> top until it was fully coated. I then sat it into my pan of oil and let it just roll <time_token_70> <time_token_72> around for 3 or 4 minutes until it is nice and golden brown before sitting it on kitchen <time_token_72> <time_token_74> towel. And all I did then was repeat those steps with my remaining frankfurters I even <time_token_74> <time_token_76> jizzled on a little bit of mustard and I was not really sure what people normally have <time_token_76> <time_token_78> on these I have seen mustard is quite popular but what do you normally have on your corn <time_token_78> <time_token_82> dog let me know down below but that is it my friends super easy oh my goodness I can <time_token_82> <time_token_85> see why these are so popular they are pretty darn amazing you have this sugary foamy crunchy <time_token_85> <time_token_87> layer on the outside just delicate enough mixing them well with that mustard so please <time_token_87> <time_token_89> let me know if this passes your american seal of approval and what you put on yours if you <time_token_89> <time_token_91> enjoyed this video do not forget to give it a thumbs up share subscribe comment all that <time_token_91> <time_token_93> stuff good luck with the super bowl if you are cheering on the Chicago Bulls like I am <time_token_93> <time_token_95> wink good times guys see you next time bye.

installation <time_token_5> <time_token_6> of my Great Burger recreation series. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> I've received a bunch of requests to do a Five Guys Burger. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> I agree Five Guys Killer Burger, a secret to their success is keeping it simple. <time_token_8> <time_token_8> They don't have a big crazy menu. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> The ingredients are very, very fresh and that's what we're going to try to do here. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> So without any further ado, let's get started. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> First I want to cover the toppings that I like to choose when I go to Five Guys. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> I personally like to keep my burgers there kind of simple and that's what we're going <time_token_12> <time_token_13> I usually make my burger exactly how I order it at Five Guys and we're going to go with <time_token_13> <time_token_15> ketchup, mustard, mayo, onions which I'm going to grill up, tomato, some hand leaf lettuce <time_token_15> <time_token_16> and some nice American deli style cheese. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> This is not the type that comes wrapped in plastic. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> Let's get to making those patties now. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Alright, so obviously I have two patties of 80-20, some parchment laid out. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> What I'm going to do is place this. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Now Five Guys, they're using like three and a half ounces. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> I don't have a scale so I don't know, I just wanted to keep them even. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> This is for me anyway, I'm not making any money on these things. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> Anyway, they actually stack theirs four high and I think that's just for production reasons. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Alright now what they use is this big stainless steel trowel thing to flatten them. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> I'm going to use my old burger smasher from my smash burger video and I'm going to smash <time_token_26> <time_token_27> Let's see what happens here. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> Yep, looks pretty good, I'm going to add a little bit more. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Alright let's get these things out to the grill. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Alright so let's get these burgers going here. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> And this is regular 80-20 ground beef, I think Five Guys, one of their claims is the twice <time_token_34> <time_token_34> This is just ground beef. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> They do not season their patties, I think they're just letting the meat do the talking <time_token_36> <time_token_38> Now I'm going to grill some onions and I don't know whether they put oil on or not but I'm <time_token_38> <time_token_40> not grilling 500 onions here so I need a little bit of you know, help moisture so they don't <time_token_41> <time_token_41> get all too dried out. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> These are sesame seed buns but I luckily found these, they have a little bit more of an eggier <time_token_43> <time_token_44> base than your regular bun. <time_token_44> <time_token_47> They're not like your typical white bread buns and these on the package it was gourmet <time_token_47> <time_token_47> restaurant style buns and these are pretty similar to what Five Guys uses. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> Oh look at that. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Very nice man, you cannot ask for a better crust than that. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Buns are done. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Alright guys, let's get all this goodness into the house and we'll make some burgers <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Alright so Five Guys has a very specific way of dressing the burgers. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> There you go, three rings of ketchup on the bottom, two rings of mustard on the bottom <time_token_66> <time_token_66> We're going to go with our grilled onions. <time_token_68> <time_token_75> You know, top bun, mayo, lettuce, 5 pickles, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12, <time_token_75> <time_token_77> 1, 2, 3, 4, and what their thought is they want you to get a bite of everything in every <time_token_77> <time_token_77> And then two slices of tomato. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> Alright now for the burger. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Cheese got a little bit more melted than theirs just because while I was setting the cameras <time_token_80> <time_token_80> It's looking pretty darn good. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> Look at that. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Alright now, how they wrap this, I hope, I don't know if the spoil is big

<time_token_2> Many times, you will hear me talking about traditional French, Italian, or Spanish specialties. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> For once, this is a North American specialty, the Cesar salad. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> Although, not very well known in Europe, you can see it on the menu of some French restaurant <time_token_5> <time_token_6> The secret is the tasty creamy dressing that is a perfect combination with the crispiness <time_token_6> <time_token_6> of the roman lettuce. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> To make a beautiful Cesar salad, you will need roman lettuce, bread, salt, freshly ground <time_token_8> <time_token_10> peppercorns, anchovies, yogurt, olive oil, capers, lemon juice, English sauce or Worcestershire <time_token_10> <time_token_11> sauce, Tabasco, shredded or shaved parmesan, garlic, and fresh mayonnaise. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> Start to make the sauce. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> You may chop everything finely and mix it in a bowl, or you may use technology and a <time_token_13> <time_token_13> Place the garlic in the bowl of the food processor with a germ. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Add the anchovies fillets. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Add the capers. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Add in the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> Then add the yogurt. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> The lemon juice. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> The Worcestershire sauce. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> And the mayonnaise. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> If you are using fresh mayonnaise, you may keep the sauce for 2-3 days max in your refrigerator. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> Or if you want to keep the sauce longer, I would suggest to use commercial mayonnaise <time_token_27> <time_token_28> because in fresh mayonnaise, there is raw egg yolk. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> So that's just why. <time_token_28> <time_token_31> Then process, combine everything, taste, very nice. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> Add a little bit of seasoning. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Add salt and freshly ground peppercorns. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> Use the other side of the spoon. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> The Caesar dressing has a kick. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> I can taste the garlic, the lemon juice, the anchovies, and then the seasoning and the <time_token_39> <time_token_39> yogurt at the end. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> Resell the sauce. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> Refrigerate it until further use. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> Prepare the crotteaux. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> Cut the bread into 1-inch cubes. <time_token_44> <time_token_46> For the bread, you may use baguette or any kind of bread you like, including focaccia. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> You don't have to use fresh bread, you could use all bread. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> So do the bread. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> Add the olive oil in a large skillet. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> And add the bread. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Put the crotteaux on high heat and settle them to have them nicely golden brown. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> The crotteaux are very important in the Caesar salad. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> They have to be crispy, they have to be golden brown, and they are so good. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> They don't have to be seasoned with garlic because it's when you eat the salad that <time_token_61> <time_token_62> you will have the crotteaux with the dressing so they will get the flavor of the sauce. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> I tell you how much I like Caesar salad and how often they don't taste good. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> Very often you will go somewhere and you order a Caesar salad, it will be disappointing because <time_token_65> <time_token_66> the sauce doesn't have enough flavor to get combined with the lettuce. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> So this is very important to have a dressing that is full of flavor. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> If you want to save some crotteaux, you may not saute the crotteaux in the olive oil and <time_token_70> <time_token_71> just place them on a cookie sheet and bake them at 400-425 degrees Fahrenheit until golden <time_token_72> <time_token_72> You will save quite a few crotteaux. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> And then turn off the heat and place the crotteaux on a paper towel to absorb any excess <time_token_76> <time_token_76> Good, let's finish the salad. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Cut the roman lettuce into a bad size so I have pre-washed my salad and pat dry it. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> So cut the leaves into 3 quarter to 1 inch pieces. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> Actually I am going to keep that one as a garnish. <time_token_82> <time_token_85> Add some sauce, 1, 2, 3 tablespoons per head, some crotteaux and toss. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> You want to have every piece of salad, every crotteaux, toss with the dressing. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Heat and serve into a bowl. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> Don't forget

I have an incredible treat for you guys. <time_token_0> <time_token_1> I used to work at a steakhouse that did these little lobster corn dogs, and this morning <time_token_1> <time_token_2> for some reason me and Rachel woke up with this hankering for corn dogs, so we went down <time_token_2> <time_token_3> to the mall, picked up a corn dog on a stick, and it just sort of popped into my head that <time_token_3> <time_token_4> I used to make these lobster corn dogs almost every single day for like a year straight. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> So I figured why not share this recipe with you guys, it's going to absolutely blow your <time_token_5> <time_token_6> You know, corn dogs are incredible already, but fill in the lobster and you have a totally, <time_token_6> <time_token_7> you know, you totally elevate the idea of a corn dog to the next level. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> So with that said, let's go in the kitchen and show you guys how to make these lobster <time_token_9> <time_token_10> So in this recipe I'm using fresh lobster tails straight from the store, and it's really <time_token_10> <time_token_11> important they use freshly cleaned lobsters because frozen lobster tails tend to stick <time_token_11> <time_token_12> through the shells after they're cooked, and that will prevent a clean removal of the meat. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> So once you've tied the tails together with a little bit of butcher's twine or just plain <time_token_15> <time_token_16> old string, get some water on a rolling boil and you're going to cook the tails for about <time_token_16> <time_token_17> ten minutes and the claws for around seven. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> So after you're finished boiling the lobster, you're going to quickly grab a bowl of ice <time_token_19> <time_token_19> water and then place all the lobster meat in this ice water which is going to shock <time_token_19> <time_token_20> the meat and cool it down so it doesn't overcook. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> So once the lobster is completely cooled down, remove it from the bath and then you're going <time_token_24> <time_token_25> to start to take the shells off with just a little bit of pressure, a cloth, and some <time_token_34> <time_token_35> So when you come to the claw of the lobster, the first thing you want to do is remove the <time_token_35> <time_token_36> After that, take the bottom pincer off and then wrap the claw in a towel and give it <time_token_36> <time_token_37> a few smacks of the back of your knife and the meat should come sliding out fairly easily. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> So in order to get to the knuckle meat, you're going to need a decent pair of shears. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> Make two incisions opposite of each other on the shell. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> Once all your lobster meat is completely cleaned and all the shells are removed from <time_token_50> <time_token_51> it, all you have to do now is start skewing everything up. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> So once your lobster is skewered up and ready to go, all you have to do now is make your <time_token_58> <time_token_58> batter for frying. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> And in this is basically just a corn muffin mix that I bought from the store, some milk <time_token_60> <time_token_60> and an egg, and all you have to do is completely incorporate the mixture. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> One thing I would recommend before embarking on this recipe is try to find some sort of <time_token_73> <time_token_73> stick holder that would hold the skewer in place as it fries. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> I'm not too sensitive to oil popping on my hands, but for those of you who have sensitive <time_token_75> <time_token_76> skin or aren't used to it, I would definitely look out for something like that. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> So once you're done frying lobster corn dogs, just gently place them on a towel to blot <time_token_78> <time_token_79> off any excess oil and I'm going to plate these with a little bit of whole grain honey <time_token_79> <time_token_80> mustard and there you have it, some beautiful lobster corn dogs. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Alright so these beautiful corn dogs are finished, that was a pretty intense process but definitely <time_token_82> <time_token_82> worth the while. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> A little bit of this spicy honey mustard, because what's a corn dog with that mustard? <time_token_85> <time_token_86> She's a nice little red tinge of the lobster, really really crispy, has that sweet flavor <time_token_86> <time_token_87> from the corn, nice and buttery. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> This honey mustard is killer, it's like a little spicy because it's whole grain but <time_token_89> <time_token_90> the honey, because of that sweetness, kind of cools it down just a little bit. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Well hopefully you guys enjoyed this recipe, definitely a nice and tender lobster, beautiful <time_token_92> <time_token_93> crispy corn dog, so hopefully you guys enjoyed. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> If you did, please

Now I'm not quite sure what's more comforting than a nice warm soup on a cold night. <time_token_2> <time_token_5> Now it's approaching winter, autumn down in the southern hemisphere and I know it's a bit different up for you northerners. <time_token_5> <time_token_8> But I've got a terrific tomato soup recipe. I think you'll be very surprised at how easy it is to make and how good it tastes in the end. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> So I hope you guys enjoy it. <time_token_16> <time_token_20> Cool beans. We're just going to grab a deep pan or you can use a large pot and we're just going to put this on a medium heat. <time_token_20> <time_token_23> And once it's heated up we're going to stick in a little bit of oil followed by one medium onion that we've just diced up roughly. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> And three cloves of garlic that once again we just chopped up roughly. They don't need to be precise chopping. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> We're going to blend it later so it doesn't really matter. <time_token_26> <time_token_29> And to this we're going to add one carrot and one stick of celery that we've also just chopped up. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> We're just going to cook this on like I said a medium heat until the carrots go nice and soft but they hold their shape. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> And the onion should start browning a little bit, getting a little bit golden. <time_token_33> <time_token_36> Our vegetables have been frying away for around 10-15 minutes. So now we can stick in our stock. <time_token_36> <time_token_38> Now I've got two cubes of chicken stock that have just dissolved in a litre of water. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> So we can add this to our vegetables here. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> Following this we're going to stick in one 400g tin of tinned tomatoes. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> And to this we can also add two tablespoons of tomato paste. <time_token_44> <time_token_46> If you don't have tomato paste you could substitute with tomato ketchup or tomato sauce. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> It will just add a little bit of a nicer base to it. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Following this we're going to stick in four large ripe tomatoes. <time_token_49> <time_token_52> The more ripe they are the better. So get the really ripe ones, chop them up roughly and then chuck them into the pan with everything else. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Give it a stir around and we're just going to bring this to the boil. <time_token_54> <time_token_56> Once our tomato soup is boiling we're just going to turn it down for it to simmer for around 15 minutes. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> This will just give it a chance for everything to soften and really incorporate the flavours together. <time_token_57> <time_token_60> So at this point we can stick in our salt and pepper. So make sure you're seasoned to taste. <time_token_60> <time_token_63> And I also like to stick in some basil. So get a large handful of fresh basil. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> Just chop it up willy-nilly, it doesn't need to be precise and chuck it into our soup. <time_token_65> <time_token_67> And also I like to, personally I like to stick in a dash of balsamic vinegar. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> It will pair really nicely with your tomatoes, giving it a nice sweetness to your soup. <time_token_69> <time_token_71> So you can stick in a dash of this at the end just before you get to blend it. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> At this point your tomato soup should be exactly how you want it. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> So if it's a little bit bitter you might want to add a little bit of sugar. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Likewise you might want to add a little bit of salt and pepper. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> So you season to your taste and then we can stick this into a blender. <time_token_78> <time_token_81> So blend it all up, put it on the high setting for about a minute and it will be a nice smooth consistency. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Now if it's too thick of a soup and you want a little bit more runnier, <time_token_82> <time_token_83> a little bit more water, blend it again and it will really thin out. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> Serve your soup hot with a little bit of basil on top if you wish. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> Some nice toasted bread, a little bit of butter and there Bob's your uncle. <time_token_88> <time_token_90> So I really hope you enjoy it. You can leave out certain steps like the celery, the carrots if you want <time_token_90> <time_token_91> and just stick with the onion and garlic base. <time_token_91> <time_token_93> It's entirely up to you but this is a really simple, very very quick soup <time_token_93> <time_token_94> that can really warm up those colder nights. <time_token_94> <time_token_96> So I hope you guys enjoyed it.

make a shepherd's pie. <time_token_1> <time_token_1> What is a shepherd's pie? <time_token_1> <time_token_2> Well, it's a cottage pie that instead of using ground beef, it's ground lamb. <time_token_2> <time_token_4> It's just a meat and potatoes kind of dish, which is why I like it, and it's made with <time_token_4> <time_token_4> lamb, which I love lamb. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> I realize that's not the most popular cut of meat or animal, but anyway, I have in the <time_token_5> <time_token_5> way I like it a lot. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> So anyway, pan's hot, oil's hot now, good swirl. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> I've got two cups of onion and half a cup of carrot cut up. <time_token_9> <time_token_9> To be honest, I've got a little bit more than half a cup of carrot. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> Now we're going to take, we're going to put a little bit of salt in here. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> Salt helps the vegetables cook a little better. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> My vegetables are just starting to get a little color on them, we're going to throw two tablespoons <time_token_14> <time_token_19> of butter in here, two cloves of garlic, we're going to put in two pounds of lamb <time_token_19> <time_token_20> that I bought a couple of days ago, that's why it's got some brown in it, but it's still <time_token_20> <time_token_21> good and fresh, it's edible, I'm not going to kill anybody today. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> Anyway, we're going to brown this up a little bit. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Okay, we've got our meat starting to brown a little bit, I want to go ahead and I want <time_token_22> <time_token_23> to season the meat, a little bit of salt. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> Now the stock that I'm using today is the homemade stock and there's no, I didn't put <time_token_25> <time_token_26> any salt in that, so if you're using a store-bought stock that has lots of salt in it, you may <time_token_26> <time_token_27> not want to put any salt in there, I'm going to put a little black pepper. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> Now for herbs, you can kind of use whatever you like, I mean I'm going to put about a <time_token_30> <time_token_31> tablespoon of Italian seasoning because it has a nice mix of things, but anyway there's <time_token_31> <time_token_33> half a tablespoon, there's one tablespoon, and then we're going to brown this meat up. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Alright, we've got a little color on our meat now, I'm going to mix that up a little bit, <time_token_34> <time_token_35> and what we're going to do now is I've got two tablespoons of flour, we're going to dump <time_token_35> <time_token_36> this in, we're going to mix it up and we're going to put a little color on this, and then <time_token_36> <time_token_37> what this is going to do is help thicken our sauce, our broth, or whatever you want to <time_token_37> <time_token_38> Anyway, let me get this browned up a little bit, alright, we've got that mixed in, see <time_token_38> <time_token_39> I've got some browning happening at the bottom of my pan, I've got two cups of lamb broth <time_token_39> <time_token_40> or stock, I'm going to put this in, and we're going to cook this down. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Okay, we've got our heat turned down, this is just simmering along, come around once <time_token_42> <time_token_43> in a while, scrape the bottom, that way you scrape up any brown bits on the bottom because <time_token_43> <time_token_44> that's really good stuff, you want that in here, and we're just going to cook this down <time_token_44> <time_token_44> until it's really, really thick. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Alright, so now, our mixture's thickening up, that looks really good, so we'll go ahead <time_token_46> <time_token_46> and turn this off. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> Now, what I'm going to do is I have half a cup of frozen peas, and put them in there, <time_token_48> <time_token_51> get a little stir, kind of blend them in, oh, by the way, I have my oven preheating <time_token_51> <time_token_52> at 350 degrees F, it's not quite there yet, but it's getting there. <time_token_53> <time_token_56> So now, I'm going to assemble this, alright, there we go, I have a dish, now you can use <time_token_56> <time_token_60> any kind of oven safe dish that you want to use, it really doesn't matter, make sure <time_token_60> <time_token_62> I get some of this juice in there, there we go, I'm just about half way up my dish, <time_token_62> <time_token_63> it's good, now I've got plenty left over, but what you can do is you can make one to <time_token_63> <time_token_64> cook now, make another one, and then you can actually wrap it up and freeze it. <time_token_64> <time_token_67> Now, put some potatoes, these are just left over mashed potatoes, for the mashed potatoes <time_token_67> <time_token_68> I took and boiled some potatoes, so they were nice and soft, mashed them with some <time_token_70> <time_token_71> butter and cream, now I'm going to spread this out a little bit, <time_token_73> <time_token_78> just like putting in sheetrock, it tastes a lot better, and you want to make sure that <time_token_78> <time_token_79> you have a little bit of room at the top, because you're going to have liquid bubbling <time_token_79> <time_token_81> up through there, now I want to make some ridges for it, so increase the surface area <time_token_81> <time_token_84> of the potatoes and help them brown up, and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to <time_token_84> <time_token_85> pop this in the oven until the top is nice and brown and bubbly, alright so let's take <time_token_87> <time_token_88> it out of the oven, oh man that looks good, now I'm going to let it sit there and cool <time_token_88> <time_token_89> down before I cut into it, and I'm going to go ahead and take a paper towel, just because <time_token_89> <time_token_91> I'm extremely health conscious, and dab up some of this grease off the top of it, you <time_token_93> <time_token_94> don't really have to eat that, oh man that looks good and smells really good, <time_token_94> <time_token_96> see how it tastes, oh man ", "duration": 527.17, "segments": [[8, 23], [43, 50], [58, 69], [75,

<time_token_1> Hello there, welcome back to the once a week kitchen. Today I've decided to do bangers <time_token_1> <time_token_3> and mash with a super duper onion sauce. In the pan I've got 2 kilos of potatoes and <time_token_3> <time_token_4> a teaspoonful of salt. I've covered them in cold water bringing them to the boil and then <time_token_4> <time_token_6> I will boil them for about 20 minutes until they're soft. Meanwhile I'm going to cook <time_token_6> <time_token_7> the bangers. I've got 8 sausages in the frying pan. I'm cooking these on quite a low gas. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> Don't want them to brown too quickly and I shall just keep turning them until they're <time_token_9> <time_token_10> well done all over while the potatoes are boiling for the mash. Meanwhile I want to <time_token_10> <time_token_11> make onion sauce to go with the bangers and mash. Right, onion sauce. This is delicious. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> It's wonderful with bangers and mash but you can have it with other meals as well, whatever <time_token_12> <time_token_14> you fancy. Basic white sauce really, with onions in. So I've got an ounce of butter <time_token_14> <time_token_15> in the pan. We do it slightly differently with it being onion sauce so I'm going to <time_token_15> <time_token_16> melt that. I've got 4 ounces of finely chopped onions, an ounce of plain flour, a teaspoon <time_token_16> <time_token_18> full of heat, half a teaspoon full each of salt and pepper and some milk. It will take <time_token_18> <time_token_19> about maybe 3 quarters of a pint of milk. So we melt the butter in the pan and what <time_token_19> <time_token_21> we're going to do, we're going to saute the onions gently so that they soften but I don't <time_token_21> <time_token_22> want them to brown so that they go sort of clear and soft but not brown and crispy at <time_token_22> <time_token_26> all. So the butter's melting in the pan now. So I'm going to pop in the onions. Right, <time_token_26> <time_token_28> the onions are sizzling gently now. I just want them to sweat, just to soften and very <time_token_28> <time_token_30> little colour. So we do this for about 5 minutes over a low heat until they're soft. The onions <time_token_30> <time_token_33> are softened now so I'm going to add in some pepper and the plain flour. I'm going to stir <time_token_33> <time_token_35> that in and what we want is for the flour to cook for at least 30 seconds but as soon <time_token_35> <time_token_36> as it's all over the onions I'll leave it a minute. We don't want the sauce to taste <time_token_36> <time_token_38> flour then. It'll be alright just to sizzle away there for a minute. It's important to <time_token_38> <time_token_40> do that if you don't do it the sauce will taste flour then. I'm going to start adding <time_token_42> <time_token_42> the milk now. If you keep stirring it there shouldn't be any lumps in the sauce. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> Ooops, nearly lost the camera then. <time_token_48> <time_token_51> So I'm going to keep stirring until it comes to the boil and thickens. The sauce has just <time_token_51> <time_token_53> come into the boil now and it's very thick. It's not until you get it to the boil that <time_token_53> <time_token_54> you can tell what consistency it is. So at this stage I'm going to add some more milk. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> So I want it to pour over the blangers and mash. Not just sit there in a great big lump. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> So I want it just to be thickened but not too thick. You'll get to know how you'll like <time_token_58> <time_token_61> it when you make some yourself. It looks lovely and creamy. It just needs to simmer <time_token_61> <time_token_64> for a minute and that's it. Then the sauce is done. Right the onion sauce is cooked now <time_token_64> <time_token_65> and the blangers are doing very well. So I'm going to swap the potatoes to the front because <time_token_65> <time_token_67> I believe in that they're cooked as well now. Turn that gas down at the back and to burn the sauce. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> Right these potatoes are well soft now. So I'm going to drain off the liquid and then show you how I mash them. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> The potato masher is very very delicate. We don't want a lumpy mash. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Brendan Mann called Nick called the chef. Says that the best way to do this is with an electric mixer. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> So there's another option for that. But personally I can never be bothered to get the mixer out. <time_token_79> <time_token_81> And with this that's all you need to wash up. So the next thing is another knob of butter. <time_token_82> <time_token_85> Be generous with the butter and a little bit of milk. What we do then is cream milk until the butter melts in and the milk is all whipped in. <time_token_85> <time_token_87> If you've got a little bit of cream that's perfectly good as well. But milk and butter is usually good in it. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> Now if you've done a dinner it's worthwhile doing a bit pan of this because once it's cooled any leftovers you can freeze them in with the portions in freezer bags. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> And then you can use it for all kinds of things. <time_token_91> <time_token_93> Right, I'm going to mash. Now I like my sausages very black. So that is not a mistake. That's how I like. <time_token_93> <time_token_96> Nice portion of lovely mash and some beautiful onion sauce on the side. Gorgeous. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> Bon appetit. See you later.

"asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_2> Welcome back to my show Desi Aroma and this is a continues from my dosa videos <time_token_2> <time_token_5> so the batter which I showed you all in my last video and if you haven't seen <time_token_5> <time_token_6> it you can go back and see how the batter is done this is how the batter <time_token_6> <time_token_9> looks and it's all fermented and ready to go now I told you that this batter <time_token_9> <time_token_11> needs some salt before you make the dosa but I'm not going to take salt and <time_token_11> <time_token_12> mix it in the whole batter because that ruins your batter so what I'm going to <time_token_12> <time_token_15> do is I'm going to remove some of the batter in this smaller container I have <time_token_15> <time_token_18> and I'll just use exactly what I need for my for my dosa so I'm separating <time_token_18> <time_token_20> some batter in here and then I'm going to add just enough salt in there what I <time_token_20> <time_token_23> need so in this you know about this much salt is okay and then I'm going to just <time_token_23> <time_token_25> mix this batter up and that is ready for my dosa so let's go ahead and make some <time_token_25> <time_token_27> doses now I have my fry pan and by yourself a non-stick it definitely <time_token_27> <time_token_30> helps I've got that on medium-high for about a minute and all minute two <time_token_30> <time_token_31> minutes what I'm going to do is I want to make sure that the temperature is <time_token_31> <time_token_33> exactly right so what you're doing is sprinkling some cold water on it have <time_token_33> <time_token_35> yourself a small towel take a spoonful of this and just spread this up on your <time_token_35> <time_token_38> on your pan to the size you need and once you have done that go ahead and put <time_token_38> <time_token_41> the cover on it so the dosa steams and makes a nice crisp from the top and the <time_token_41> <time_token_43> bottom the dosa is out so we're going to do a second one here again sprinkle <time_token_43> <time_token_46> water on it and then wipe it off you have a nice clean fry pan take one of <time_token_46> <time_token_49> this set it in and just spread it see how easily it spreads just spread it <time_token_49> <time_token_51> there we go that's a perfect spread there and then we'll go ahead and cover <time_token_51> <time_token_54> this up and if you would like plain dosa here you would just spring out put <time_token_54> <time_token_56> that oil or the desi heat and let it crisp from the bottom and you can <time_token_56> <time_token_57> remove it fold it or remove it like that and that would be your plain dosa okay <time_token_57> <time_token_59> so now what I'm looking at this about you know a minute or so I'm looking some <time_token_59> <time_token_61> brown sticks on my dosa and that's I know is it's ready to be removed that <time_token_61> <time_token_63> cover you can see how nicely it has fluffed up and the holes you know those <time_token_63> <time_token_65> are what you're looking for I'm using desi here feel free to use the oil if <time_token_65> <time_token_68> you want just sprinkle some on this and then I'm going to take about a tablespoon <time_token_68> <time_token_70> of my potato filling which I made for the dosa and I'm going to just set it <time_token_70> <time_token_72> right in the center there maybe a little more there right in the center <time_token_72> <time_token_74> and then I'm going to cover this again for about you know I would say 10 <time_token_74> <time_token_76> seconds or so because I'm still waiting on that to turn a little more nice and <time_token_76> <time_token_79> brown and the desi heat can nicely mold in it and once that is done okay so I <time_token_79> <time_token_81> think it's ready to come out and what do you do is you just take this dosa see <time_token_81> <time_token_83> how it's leaving the sides and off and that's the technique what you use for <time_token_83> <time_token_85> spraying the water on off and just go ahead and close this dosa so we're going <time_token_85> <time_token_87> to close it from one side and then close it from the other side and just take it <time_token_87> <time_token_90> out in in a plate so that's your dosa which has come out again for watching <time_token_90> <time_token_93> desi aroma this video was for the masala dosa you know try it you love it <time_token_93> <time_token_95> and please put in your comments for us to read and

what's for dinner <time_token_0> <time_token_1> I recently showed you how to make a carne asada marinade and now we're going to make the carne asada <time_token_1> <time_token_2> We're going to marinate this it's early in the day and I'm going to marinate these all day <time_token_2> <time_token_3> And then Rick's gonna throw these on a really hot grill and they're gonna take no time at all to cook <time_token_3> <time_token_5> This is thinly sliced sirloin tip. Okay, you can see what that looks like and <time_token_5> <time_token_5> There's one two, three four <time_token_5> <time_token_7> Four there's six slices here and what we're gonna do is we're gonna take this meat. We're gonna put it <time_token_7> <time_token_8> in a ziplock bag, this is just my preferred method of <time_token_8> <time_token_9> Marination because it's quick. It's easy and it's convenient and it has easy cleanup. So <time_token_10> <time_token_11> You can do this in a glass container you can do it in a plastic container you can do it do not do it in aluminum <time_token_11> <time_token_13> Container and then I also have some of the I squeezed some citrus to put in my marinade <time_token_13> <time_token_14> And I'm going to go ahead and put the shells <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Right in here with the meat and I'm gonna rip some of these oranges up because they're kind of big <time_token_16> <time_token_17> And I'm gonna put all of these in here because that way I get <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Maximum flavor for my money and this marinade if you haven't watched this video yet <time_token_18> <time_token_19> I'll put a link below to where you can go and watch it <time_token_19> <time_token_20> We're just gonna pour this right over. I <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Am going to remove as much air as possible from the bag <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Then just give this a good massage and get all of those flavors really <time_token_26> <time_token_28> Incorporated and get that marinade nestled right in there with all that meat and those citrus shells get those incorporate in there <time_token_28> <time_token_28> Don't be afraid your bag is not gonna break <time_token_28> <time_token_30> Just you know try really hard not to break that seal if you do then, you know, you're gonna have to clean up a little bit <time_token_30> <time_token_30> That's all. All right. So what we're gonna do now <time_token_31> <time_token_32> We're gonna just seal this up. We're gonna put it in the fridge until it's time to grill <time_token_32> <time_token_33> And when it's time to do that, we'll be back and we'll show you what Rick's gonna do with them <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Hey, it decided to rain. So we're gonna go ahead and sear these off inside and you know <time_token_34> <time_token_36> Cori Asada traditionally done on the barbecue, but you know today just didn't make it. So I have my skillet <time_token_36> <time_token_36> It is smoking hot. I sprayed it with some oil <time_token_37> <time_token_37> And these aren't going to take any time to cook <time_token_41> <time_token_41> Just like that <time_token_41> <time_token_42> See look at that's nice <time_token_42> <time_token_43> You'll be able to tell when it's time to flip it because it'll easily release from the bottom of the pan <time_token_43> <time_token_43> It's almost there <time_token_44> <time_token_44> And also you'll be able to see it almost finished cooking on this side as well <time_token_45> <time_token_45> I'm gonna go ahead and turn it <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Look at that. That is beautiful <time_token_46> <time_token_47> We're gonna let that sear off on the second side. I'm gonna set it off on a different plate <time_token_47> <time_token_48> I'm gonna finish cooking the rest of these off and then we're gonna come back and I'm gonna show you what happens next <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Hey, we have completed the cooking of all of those pieces of meat <time_token_49> <time_token_50> And what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna show you how you cut it up because you're gonna want to chop this <time_token_51> <time_token_51> So that it looks like this. Okay <time_token_51> <time_token_52> So it's easier to eat inside of a taco, so <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Okay, my tongs this is my ginormous, you know <time_token_54> <time_token_56> Serial killer knife that I hardly ever use but this is one instance where you can use your butcher knife <time_token_56> <time_token_58> So rejoice if you have a butcher knife and you've never really used it. Okay grasp it firmly by the handle like this <time_token_58> <time_token_59> okay, and then what you're gonna do is we're gonna make several chops all the way down and <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Don't worry if it doesn't cut all the way through because we're gonna chop right back and then we're gonna turn it and we're gonna <time_token_60> <time_token_60> Chop the other way so we chop it in tiny little pieces <time_token_60> <time_token_62> Okay, and this may or may not be how you do it if you are authentic Mexican and you have you know <time_token_62> <time_token_63> You are an expert at making carne asada. That's fine <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Then you know, I'll be at your channel and I'll be looking at how you do things <time_token_64> <time_token_65> But this is how I do them in my house. I grew up in in Arizona 30 years <time_token_65> <time_token_66> So, you know, this is how we do it because it's quick and it's easy and it's delicious. So here we go <time_token_66> <time_token_68> Then we gather them up we turn them the other way and chop in the other direction <time_token_70> <time_token_72> You see any really big pieces you can just hit them with your butcher knife and go from there and then you just add them to <time_token_72> <time_token_74> the rest of the chopped and there you have a plate with two delicious carne asada tacos and <time_token_74> <time_token_74> They have the works. There's a little peek of the guy. Oh, there's a little homemade guacamole <time_token_74> <time_token_75> There's some lettuce and green onions some Mexican cheese <time_token_75> <time_token_76> And then on the side here we have I was gonna make a refried beans <time_token_76> <time_token_77> But I just got too busy and making everything else and I forgot <time_token_77> <time_token_78> So we have a little guacamole salad here with some shredded lettuce some homemade guacamole a little tomato a little onion and a little <time_token_78> <time_token_80> Daisy on the top. So there you have it homemade carne asada tacos <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Even if it rained we didn't get rained out. They're really really awesome on the grill <time_token_81> <time_token_82> They're really really awesome in the house and make sure after you chop your meat that you salt it <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Well, because this meat loves to be seasoned <time_token_83> <time_token_84> So I hope that you try this and I hope that you really really love it because it's delicious <time_token_84> <time_token_85> You can find the recipe on my website <time_token_85> <time_token_86> That's Noreen's kitchen calm and I thank you so much for stopping by my kitchen this evening <time_token_86> <time_token_86> And I hope that someday you give these tacos a try <time_token_86> <time_token_88> Hey, if you are new to my channel and you are just watching me for the first time or you haven't subscribed yet <time_token_88> <time_token_88> please consider hitting the subscribe button so you don't miss out on a minute of <time_token_88> <time_token_90> all the fun that goes on in my kitchen with me and my husband and my crazy family and our menagerie a <time_token_90> <time_token_90> zoo, um also <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Leave me a comment.

Welcome to Inspire to Cook. <time_token_1> <time_token_3> Today I'm going to show you how to make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich. <time_token_3> <time_token_5> It's going to be cheese and leashes and you can easily do it at home. Let's do it. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> All you're going to need for this is a little bit of butter, cheese of course, <time_token_7> <time_token_8> and I'm going to use the white bread. You can use the bread of your choice. <time_token_8> <time_token_11> Of course we need the actual pan to fry it, the flipping thing to flip it with. <time_token_11> <time_token_14> And I'm going to use a little bit of mayonnaise. I'm actually going to use the homemade mayonnaise. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> I'm going to use the homemade mayonnaise we've done in the previous video. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> You can check it out at the link in the description and it's going to be very simple. <time_token_17> <time_token_20> Let's do it. First thing I'm going to do, I'm going to put my small pan on the cooktop <time_token_20> <time_token_21> and I'm going to switch it up to medium medium high. <time_token_21> <time_token_24> All right then I'm going to grab my two pieces of bread and put my mayonnaise on top of it. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> Just a little bit. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> And we're going to apply mayonnaise on one surface of each piece of bread <time_token_28> <time_token_31> and we're going to go to our pan. Then we're going to cut a small piece of butter <time_token_31> <time_token_33> and throw it on our pan. Make sure it's hot so it starts melting right away. <time_token_33> <time_token_36> And we're going to grab our first piece of bread and put it with the mayonnaise side down on the pan. <time_token_36> <time_token_38> And we're going to throw about four pieces of cheese on our bread. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> You can put six depending on how much you like it. <time_token_39> <time_token_41> And we're going to cover it up with our other piece of bread with the mayonnaise side up. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> Make sure you actually keep the heat on medium to medium low <time_token_43> <time_token_45> when you have the sandwich on the pan as it actually helps the cheese melt <time_token_45> <time_token_47> proportionally before the bread starts frying too much. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> You cannot let it fry for a little while until one side of bread actually grills a little bit <time_token_49> <time_token_50> and gets a little bit of a color on one side. <time_token_50> <time_token_52> The beauty of this recipe is very simple. You can do it in any weather. <time_token_52> <time_token_54> You don't have to go out outside to grill it. So why not? <time_token_54> <time_token_57> Okay one side looks like it's about to be done. So we're going to pick it up and flip it. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> And if you didn't grill it enough on one side, <time_token_59> <time_token_61> we can come back to it and grill it and flip it again. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> So we know that we need to hold it a little bit longer. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> You can smell the cheese-liciousness of this sandwich. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> The other side looks like it's completely ready. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> So I flipped it and we're going to let it sit for another side to make it as brown. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> All right. It looks like the sandwich is ready. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> We're going to put it in our pan, let it rest for a little <time_token_73> <time_token_76> and I'm going to cut it along to make it look even nicer and to make it easier to eat. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> Or even in four pieces to make sure it's easy and comfortable to eat. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> As you see the cheese is actually all nice and melty. <time_token_81> <time_token_84> Mmm. Cheese-licious. The bread is crunchy. The cheese is melting hot. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> I hope you guys enjoyed this video.

everything <time_token_2> <time_token_4> out and to compost and if you can't compost it, try to eat it, such as this watermelon <time_token_4> <time_token_6> There's an abundance of it right now and it's my favorite fruit so instead of throwing away <time_token_6> <time_token_7> the rind, I use the outer green part, compost that and the inner part to make a really light, <time_token_7> <time_token_8> crunchy and refreshing and easier version of kimchi. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> This one is my favorite fruit, so the fruit part, the meat part of it is my favorite part <time_token_10> <time_token_11> but the part we're looking for here is that inner white rind. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> So this is like a perfect recession food, nothing gets thrown away. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> So using an ice cream scoop, I want to scoop out all of the meat and put it in a bowl and <time_token_14> <time_token_16> I love blending chunks of frozen watermelon with some agave and some lime and doing kind <time_token_16> <time_token_17> of like a watermelon slush in the summertime, it's so delicious. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> So this will definitely be eaten but like I said, we're looking for that white rind <time_token_19> <time_token_19> part so I'm going to scoop all of this out. <time_token_19> <time_token_21> Second step is to shave off all the outer green bits so you want to make sure you scrub <time_token_21> <time_token_22> your watermelon pretty well because a lot of people have handled it. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> So just for sanitary reasons but this is what the inside looks like. <time_token_23> <time_token_26> I have scraped it all of its juicy bits and you want to take a sharp knife and you want <time_token_26> <time_token_27> to start shaving away at it. <time_token_27> <time_token_29> So I like to take the top part off like this and don't forget to compost this stuff. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> Every bit of this stuff, all parts of this watermelon can be used so it's just a great <time_token_31> <time_token_31> way to reduce waste too. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> And then just shave down kind of like you would when you segment an orange, just like <time_token_33> <time_token_35> And then just keep working down, making little strips until your entire watermelon is left <time_token_35> <time_token_35> with just the white. <time_token_35> <time_token_38> Now I just want to cut little strips into them so cut it down in half and let's see. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> Let's cut this in half as well and then just take that and maybe make little cuts like <time_token_40> <time_token_41> this, little strips like that. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> I've tumbled all my little shards into a bowl and I want to sprinkle over with some coarse <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Kosher or table or fine salt will not work here so you want to make sure you get your <time_token_44> <time_token_46> hands on some coarse sea salt and use your hands and kind of massage it. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> And the purpose for this is for it to draw out all that excess moisture. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Can't talk today, I'm bumbling around for my words. <time_token_48> <time_token_50> But yeah, because it's a very juicy fruit, it's going to still be a pretty juicy finished <time_token_50> <time_token_51> product when you bite into it, it'll be crisp and refreshing, but it'll draw out and extract <time_token_51> <time_token_52> all that extra moisture. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> So you want to kind of sit in this salt for about an hour or so. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> While my rind is hanging out, it gives me ample time to make my paste. <time_token_55> <time_token_58> So to the bowl, I want to add in my finely minced garlic, my finely minced ginger, and <time_token_58> <time_token_60> then gochugaru, which is the Korean pepper flakes, not the powder, so slide that in as <time_token_60> <time_token_61> And then I have some green onions. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> And you can use sugar, agave, or honey. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> I'm using honey because I have an abundance of honey today, so I'm going to drip that <time_token_65> <time_token_66> And optionally you can also use some anchovies or some brine strips and I'm going to mix <time_token_66> <time_token_68> this together and set it aside until my rind is ready to be mixed with it. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> I have drained and rinsed my rind, so it's just a matter of meshing the paste into my <time_token_70> <time_token_72> So I'm going to tumble in all of that paste into my big bowl with the rind, and I just <time_token_72> <time_token_72> drained and rinsed it. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> If you like that brininess and that salty bite doesn't bother you, I just took a bite <time_token_74> <time_token_75> If it doesn't bother you, just kind of let it sit and it'll act as kind of like a sauce <time_token_75> <time_token_76> to kind of combine everything together. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> But I drained and rinsed it because it is a little bit salty for me, you can always <time_token_77> <time_token_78> add a little bit of salt back in later, but you can't take it back out. <time_token_78> <time_token_80> So you want to toss this mixture for about three to four minutes until everything is <time_token_80> <time_token_81> nicely combined and the paste has kind of melted, the heat from your hand has melted <time_token_81> <time_token_82> that paste into the watermelon rind. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> My favorite way to eat this kimchi would have to be with some steamed rice and some grilled <time_token_84> <time_token_85> mackerel, some type of protein, a little bit of like sticky rice and maybe a soup <time_token_85> <time_token_87> would do too, but I'm going to go in here and just try this because I didn't sneak a <time_token_87> <time_token_88> bite while I was mixing it, so it'll be a complete surprise to see how it turned out. <time_token_91> <time_token_93> It has got such a nice salty bite and it's got the flavor and all the essence of kimchi. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> But as you saw, it came together in a flash and we utilized something that may have been <time_token_94> <time_token_95> thrown away or put in the conference tea. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> It's delicious, crunchy and refreshing. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> I hope you guys give this a try. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> I want to thank you guys for hanging out with me. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> This is the Fishy Monster and I'll see you guys very soon.

I like a lot of cheese on it. Now you're going to put it into a 400 or 450 degree <time_token_61> <time_token_64> oven and you're going to put it in there for about 10 minutes until the cheese gets nice and bubbly <time_token_64> <time_token_68> and melted.

Welcome to Hilah Cooking. Today, I'm going to show you how to make fried <time_token_1> <time_token_3> calamari like I learned how to do it from an old Greek lady. And it's real easy and there's <time_token_3> <time_token_4> only a few ingredients, but man, if you make this like as an appetizer at a party, people <time_token_4> <time_token_6> are going to be like, holy shit, this is amazing. And then it's going to be gone and like that. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> So make sure that you actually get to taste them before you take it out to your guests. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> Tip from me to you. Okay, here's what we need. So I've got some calamari tubes and some flour, <time_token_9> <time_token_10> salt and pepper, and some lemons, but get out of here lemons. We don't need you right <time_token_10> <time_token_12> now. The first thing to do is put the flour and our salt and pepper in a bag. We'll toss <time_token_12> <time_token_14> that around later. And then, so I've got these calamari, and these are just the tubes because <time_token_14> <time_token_15> my ding dong grocery store didn't have the whole squid. So I can't show you like how <time_token_15> <time_token_17> to separate the squid tubes from the tentacles. But if you had the whole ones, then you just <time_token_17> <time_token_18> like pull out the beak, pull out the guts, and then cut the tentacles off, leave the <time_token_18> <time_token_20> tentacles whole, and then slice the body parts into the little ringlets that you see <time_token_20> <time_token_21> at like Olive Garden and other fancy places. <time_token_21> <time_token_23> All right, so we want to cut these to about half an inch thick. And you want to use a <time_token_23> <time_token_26> sharp knife and get all the way through. And then we got these little tube, little ringlets. <time_token_26> <time_token_29> All right, so just throw them in your flour mixture a few pieces at a time. And then we'll <time_token_29> <time_token_33> shake them up and get it coated. And I just got a clean plate here that I'll set my little <time_token_33> <time_token_37> dredged rings on. And just kind of use your hands to shake off the excess back into the bag. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> Cool, let's dry these puppies. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> All right, so I've got my oil heated up here to 365, and I've just been kind of monitoring <time_token_40> <time_token_42> it and adjusting it with the, turning the heat up and down to keep it stable. And I'm <time_token_42> <time_token_43> going to drop these in. I'm going to use some tongs so that I can kind of like hold <time_token_43> <time_token_45> them open like this so that I end up with little fried rings and not little fried blobs <time_token_45> <time_token_49> that are stuck together. And don't do too many at once because you'll drop your temperature, <time_token_49> <time_token_51> and then they won't get as crispy. So, I'm just going to double check my tent to make <time_token_51> <time_token_55> sure it hasn't dropped too much, make sure I don't need to adjust. And we're still at <time_token_55> <time_token_56> like 360, so that's good. And they shouldn't take more than two minutes. That's the key <time_token_56> <time_token_58> to not ending up with tough chewy calamari like so oftentimes happens. It'll probably <time_token_58> <time_token_60> be more like a minute and a half or something. And they're popping and like sizzling a lot <time_token_60> <time_token_62> right now, and you'll also notice as they start to cook, and it just happened magically <time_token_62> <time_token_65> right then, a lot less sizzling and popping goes on. So, just kind of shoosh them around. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Now, you don't have to mess with them, but it kind of gives you more of a purpose when <time_token_66> <time_token_69> you're standing here slaving over a hot stove. Just kind of flip them over. They get evenly <time_token_69> <time_token_71> browned anyway, but you know, it's something to do. All right, see how you can see like <time_token_71> <time_token_72> compared to when I first dropped them in and they were all like little volcanoes squirting <time_token_72> <time_token_74> everywhere. They've really, really calmed down a lot. You guys are really maturing, <time_token_74> <time_token_75> and your behavior's gotten a lot better since you first went into the oil, so I'm very <time_token_75> <time_token_78> proud of you. Okay, I think these are done. Check that out. It's like golden brown and <time_token_78> <time_token_80> stuff like that, and real crispy, and it's like a little ringlet. Cute! Okay, so I've <time_token_80> <time_token_83> just got a little paper towel that I'm going to drain them on for a split sec. Okay, so <time_token_83> <time_token_85> these really don't need anything but a little bit of lemon, and I think that's really the <time_token_85> <time_token_86> best way to serve them. Just let them cool off for a second so I don't burn the heck <time_token_86> <time_token_90> out of my you-know-what mouth. That's awesome. That's a great little snack, appetizer, whatever. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> It's as fresh as a day at the beach, but like when you first get to the beach, not when <time_token_91> <time_token_93> you leave because by then you're all sticky and covered in sand. So there's how to make <time_token_93> <time_token_94> fried calamari. Bloop, bloop. All right, I hope you try it, and I will see you guys later.

I'm Deronda with foods 101. Today I'm going to show you how to <time_token_2> <time_token_4> make these crispy fried beer battered onion rings and let me tell you they're <time_token_4> <time_token_6> absolutely fantastic and very addictive. Now I'm using the Vidalia onions right <time_token_6> <time_token_7> now. They're abundant in the grocery store this time of the year and you're <time_token_7> <time_token_8> going to use about this size of an onion. You're going to slice the ends off, peel <time_token_8> <time_token_9> off the first layer and slice them into about one-fourth to a half an inch in <time_token_9> <time_token_11> slices. Once you get your slices cut you're going to pull them apart into <time_token_11> <time_token_12> these rings and of course the closer you get to the center of your sliced onion <time_token_12> <time_token_13> the smaller your onion ring is going to become. I've got one cup of flour, <time_token_13> <time_token_15> three-fourths of a cup of cornstarch, one teaspoon of paprika. This is the smoky <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Hungarian paprika and let me tell you folks when you bite into this onion ring <time_token_16> <time_token_17> using this smoky paprika you're going to get a burst of flavor. Absolutely <time_token_17> <time_token_19> delicious. I've got one teaspoon of baking powder, one half teaspoon of kosher <time_token_19> <time_token_21> salt, one fourth teaspoon of fresh cracked pepper and I've got one bottle a <time_token_21> <time_token_22> 12 ounce bottle of chilled beer. Now I'm using the rolling rock today but if you <time_token_22> <time_token_23> want to use a lager or whatever you have on hand that's great. Just make sure <time_token_23> <time_token_24> you've got about 12 ounces of chilled beer. Now let me show you how to get this <time_token_24> <time_token_26> together. To the flour you're going to add your baking powder, you're going to add <time_token_26> <time_token_28> your salt, paprika and pepper. Using a whisk you want to incorporate these <time_token_28> <time_token_31> five ingredients well together. Next we're going to add the beer. Slowly add <time_token_31> <time_token_34> your beer. Make sure it's chilled. It's very important that it's chilled. Oh yeah <time_token_34> <time_token_36> smells yummy with these onions and this fabulous batter and over here on the <time_token_36> <time_token_37> stove I have three cups of vegetable oil heating on medium heat. You want your <time_token_37> <time_token_41> oil about 350 degrees Fahrenheit and now we're gonna take the cornstarch, add it <time_token_41> <time_token_42> in there and give it a whisk. This is what's gonna give that onion ring an <time_token_42> <time_token_44> extra crunch of crispiness. Now that your onion ring batter is well combined <time_token_44> <time_token_46> you're gonna add about a third of your onions. Using a skewer I'm gonna go ahead <time_token_46> <time_token_48> and toss these around. So come on over here to the stovetop and I'll show you <time_token_48> <time_token_49> how to get these frying. I've got my oil heating on medium heat. You don't want to <time_token_49> <time_token_50> heat your oil any higher than that. A good five to eight minutes to heat it <time_token_50> <time_token_51> would be good but to test to make sure the oil is ready I'm gonna drop a piece <time_token_51> <time_token_53> of bread in there. If it sizzles, which it is, then it's time for the onion rings. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> So I'm gonna go ahead and get this out and I'm gonna add the onion rings. I find <time_token_55> <time_token_56> that it's best to add the onion rings with a skewer. That way you can shake off <time_token_56> <time_token_57> the excess batter on your onion and go ahead and drop it right into the oil. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> We're gonna fry this about a minute to a minute and a half on each side of the <time_token_60> <time_token_61> onion rings. Be sure not to overcrowd your pan. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> Wow! They're beginning to sizzle and smell so delicious. The onion rings have <time_token_64> <time_token_65> been frying for about three and a half minutes and I'd like to add a little bit <time_token_65> <time_token_66> more batter to the onion rings. So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to shake my <time_token_66> <time_token_68> other onion rings in a little flour. I'm going to coat the onions before I put it <time_token_68> <time_token_69> in the batter. Now back over here in the back I've lined a cookie sheet with <time_token_69> <time_token_70> about three layers of paper towels and I'm going to drain my onion rings on <time_token_70> <time_token_72> them. Now as you can see I've added a little flour to a plastic bag. I'm gonna <time_token_72> <time_token_73> add a few of my onion rings in there and I'm gonna give them a nice little shake <time_token_73> <time_token_74> before I add it into the batter. My onion rings are holding just a little <time_token_74> <time_token_76> bit more batter on them and in the hot oil they go and again these are gonna <time_token_76> <time_token_76> fry anywhere from three to four minutes. <time_token_78> <time_token_80> That means about one and a half to two minutes on each side before we turn them. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> These have been frying for about four minutes and I love the thickness of the <time_token_81> <time_token_83> batter now. Absolutely gonna be yummy and delicious. So we're gonna lie them over <time_token_83> <time_token_84> here. Let them drain and as soon as you get them out of the oil what you're <time_token_84> <time_token_85> gonna do is you're gonna add a little kosher salt to the top because if you <time_token_85> <time_token_86> let them cool that salt is not going to stick to those onion rings. Here's our <time_token_86> <time_token_88> crispy fried beer battered onion rings. I can't wait to try one. Tell you what it <time_token_88> <time_token_92> tastes like. Wow mmm crunchy delicious sweet onion fried perfectly golden. Mmm <time_token_92> <time_token_93> little hint of that Hungarian paprika is coming through. Mmm that corn starch <time_token_93> <time_token_96> gives it this extra delicious mmm crunch. You won't be disappointed. Hope <time_token_96> <time_token_97> y'all give these a try.

Okay for today's dish we need three <time_token_3> <time_token_5> fresh bratwurst, one jar of sauerkraut and some olive oil. We'll be using one <time_token_5> <time_token_7> half cup of chopped onion and also about the same amount of chopped apple, one <time_token_7> <time_token_8> garlic clove minced, a few juniper berries and one whole bay leaf. To start <time_token_8> <time_token_10> with we're going to prep our apple. We're only going to need about half of it so <time_token_10> <time_token_13> what we want to do is then peel it. Once our apple is peeled, half of it, we want <time_token_13> <time_token_16> to go ahead and just kind of give it a coarse chop. So in a medium pot we want <time_token_16> <time_token_18> to put it on medium to high heat and add our olive oil just a little bit in there <time_token_18> <time_token_20> just to coat the onions when we add them. Let that heat up. Now we'll add our onion. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Once the onion is nice and tender we're going to go ahead and add our apples <time_token_24> <time_token_27> that we chopped up and our minced garlic since they add that all together. Let those <time_token_27> <time_token_28> soften up a bit. Now what we want to do is add the whole jar of sauerkraut <time_token_28> <time_token_31> including the liquid. We're going to let this cook for a few minutes bringing the heat up just a <time_token_31> <time_token_33> tad just to get everything in here nice and warm. Okay once our sauerkraut <time_token_33> <time_token_35> mixture is warmed through but not yet boiling what we want to do then is add <time_token_35> <time_token_36> just a little bit more water probably about a quarter to a half a cup. Our <time_token_36> <time_token_38> juniper berries a good pinch of salt and our bay leaf and we're going to kind of <time_token_38> <time_token_40> mix that in there and what we want to do now is lower the heat cover and we're <time_token_40> <time_token_41> going to cook this for about half an hour to an hour. All right in another pot a <time_token_41> <time_token_43> little larger one I put some cold water and I'm going to boil it and what I'm <time_token_43> <time_token_44> going to do this is a technique I like to do takes the guesswork out of cooking <time_token_44> <time_token_46> the bratwurst. If you boil them just on a light boil they cook through and then <time_token_46> <time_token_47> there's no guesswork when you're frying them up in a pan. On our kraut it's <time_token_47> <time_token_48> simmering at low heat. We want to check on it here from time to time and make <time_token_48> <time_token_49> sure it's got enough liquid in there. You can always add a little more water if it <time_token_49> <time_token_51> looks like it's starting to dry out but this one looks really really tasty and <time_token_51> <time_token_53> it smells wonderful. So we'll let that go for another 15 minutes or so. Okay once <time_token_53> <time_token_54> our bratwurst are they've been boiling now for just a few minutes just so you <time_token_54> <time_token_55> can see that they get cooked through we want to go ahead and turn off the heat <time_token_55> <time_token_57> and what we're going to do is just put them on a plate and set aside. All right <time_token_57> <time_token_58> now we're going to check on our sauerkraut looking good it still has <time_token_58> <time_token_59> plenty of liquid it's still simmering on low heat we're going to let that cook <time_token_59> <time_token_61> for another 10 or so minutes. On a separate skillet we're going to heat up <time_token_61> <time_token_62> some butter and a little bit of olive oil to that just to keep the butter from <time_token_62> <time_token_63> burning. Let that warm up nice and evenly here kind of distribute the <time_token_63> <time_token_65> butter in the oil. Okay this is on medium to high a little more towards the high <time_token_65> <time_token_66> heat level. Butter is nice and melted and we're going to go ahead and add our <time_token_66> <time_token_68> bratwurst and start to brown them. Now that's why I boiled them before or <time_token_68> <time_token_69> parboiled them so that I know that the center is cooked pretty much and that we <time_token_69> <time_token_70> don't have to worry about these things getting really black and the insides are <time_token_70> <time_token_72> all pink and uncooked. You'll notice from the natural casing some liquid will <time_token_72> <time_token_74> escape and start to sizzle that's fine. What I do is start to lightly brown <time_token_74> <time_token_79> just kind of turn them. Let them go on the other side for a bit. We're going to go ahead and turn the flame off on the sauerkraut <time_token_79> <time_token_81> because this is nice and done. It's been cooking for about 45 minutes and we're <time_token_81> <time_token_82> going to shut the heat off and keep it covered just to keep it warm and set it aside. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Time to give our bratwurst another sift. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> Alright our bratwurst looks like they're beautifully browned and ready to be <time_token_85> <time_token_87> served up so here we go. Okay so using a slotted spoon we're going to plate up a <time_token_87> <time_token_89> nice platter of this beautiful sauerkraut and when you find the bay leaf you <time_token_89> <time_token_92> definitely want to remove it. This smells so good. Then we're going to add our <time_token_92> <time_token_94> bratwurst. Just lay them right on top. This is a beautiful traditional German <time_token_94> <time_token_96> dish. At the end I like to garnish it with a little bit of flat leaf parsley <time_token_96> <time_token_98> finely chopped. Yummy! And here we have our German style sauerkraut with bratwurst.

Welcome to our <time_token_3> <time_token_4> kitchen. Today we're doing chicken fried noodles. Now everyone knows what a delicious plate of fried <time_token_4> <time_token_6> noodles taste like but we're going to show you the secret to the juicy noodles you've ever had. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> So let's get started. So for these amazing noodles we're just going to keep it really simple. <time_token_7> <time_token_10> We've got some egg noodles, bean sprouts, broccoli, some thinly sliced carrot, diced up ginger and <time_token_10> <time_token_11> garlic and chicken thigh cut into strips. So the first thing that we're going to do is start by <time_token_11> <time_token_13> marinating our chicken. So I've got 300 grams of chicken thigh here. Now we really recommend using <time_token_13> <time_token_15> thigh instead of breast meat for this dish because it is just that much more juicy. And to that we <time_token_15> <time_token_17> just add a really classic marinade of half a teaspoon of light soy sauce, a quarter of a teaspoon <time_token_17> <time_token_19> of salt, a quarter of a teaspoon of sugar, a pinch of pepper and two tablespoons of water. We're also <time_token_19> <time_token_21> going to add one teaspoon of corn flour and a quarter of a teaspoon of baking soda. To find out <time_token_21> <time_token_23> why we use these two magic ingredients check out our pot sticker video on Food Tube. While the <time_token_23> <time_token_25> chicken is marinating we're going to get the noodles ready. Now we think you'll all agree that <time_token_25> <time_token_26> bouncy noodles are much better than soggy ones in a stir fry and to achieve that we always soak our <time_token_26> <time_token_28> noodles just so they're just softened because they'll keep cooking in the wok. Pour some boiling <time_token_28> <time_token_30> water over 250 grams of thin egg noodles and when they start to loosen up give them a swizzle. Chops <time_token_30> <time_token_32> would be great for this. Now when they're just soft and bouncy like a tangle of elastic band <time_token_32> <time_token_33> quickly drain them in a colander and you're good to go. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Okay we're ready to start cooking so we're going to start with the chicken. Get your wok super hot <time_token_37> <time_token_38> then we want to add about two tablespoons of vegetable oil. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Add in half of the ginger and garlic <time_token_40> <time_token_41> then lay the chicken out in a single layer so that we can get some nice colour on there. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Let the chicken do its thing for a couple of minutes <time_token_43> <time_token_44> then start flipping it so it ends up nicely browned all over. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> Then add in 60 milliliters of water and cover very quickly so that we can trap in all of those <time_token_48> <time_token_50> lovely flavours. So the magic that's happening in the wok right now is that the corn flour in <time_token_50> <time_token_52> the water is forming this beautiful slick gravy that's going to coat every strand of noodles. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> That's how we get them so juicy without adding loads of oil. Give it a minute to cook the chicken <time_token_53> <time_token_56> through then scoop everything out into a clean bowl and set aside. These are the best bits. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> Fire up your wok again. In goes one tablespoon of oil and the rest of the garlic and ginger. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> Let that sizzle away into a fragrant then add in half a handful of carrots, <time_token_61> <time_token_62> a whole handful of bean sprouts and a handful of broccoli. Give it a good stir. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> To cook the fish through properly we're going to give it some steam. All you have to do is add <time_token_65> <time_token_67> an 80 mils of cold water, stick a lid on it and let it cook through. Turn the heat down to low <time_token_67> <time_token_68> so the vegetables don't burn while we add in the rest of the ingredients. For the noodles cut them <time_token_68> <time_token_70> up slightly so they're easy to toss. You can do this with a pair of scissors if you like. In go <time_token_70> <time_token_72> the noodles. Now pour that lovely gravy on top along with the chicken. To season we're using <time_token_72> <time_token_74> three quarters of a teaspoon of salt, one and a quarter teaspoon of sugar and one teaspoon of dark <time_token_74> <time_token_76> soy. Slide each spatula down the side of the wok until the meat in the middle then lift both of <time_token_76> <time_token_77> them up at the same time along with a bunch of noodles. Give the noodles a little jiggle at the <time_token_77> <time_token_79> top then release. Keep repeating this until everything is mixed together and the noodles <time_token_79> <time_token_81> are heated through. So that's all there is to it guys, chicken fried noodles. Oh my god they look <time_token_81> <time_token_83> delicious and they smell amazing too. Look at those beautiful colours. So there you have it guys, <time_token_83> <time_token_85> chicken fried noodles, super juicy and super delicious. Let's tuck in. I'm going to put a <time_token_85> <time_token_87> chicken because I'm ready. And you know what there is no shame in using a fork. Yum right? <time_token_88> <time_token_90> Really plump noodles.

Today we are making tempura. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> Tempura is one of the most famous Japanese food outside of Japan. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> It is battered and deep fried seafood and vegetables. <time_token_10> <time_token_13> Tempura can be as formal as you want it to be at very expensive tempura specialty restaurants in Japan or casual home cooking. <time_token_13> <time_token_15> We'll show you the simple yet authentic way to make tasty tempura right at home. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> Let's take a look at the ingredients. <time_token_16> <time_token_20> We have shrimp and vegetables that are great for tempura, green beans, kabocha, sweet potatoes and Japanese eggplants. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> For batter, we use some cake flour. <time_token_21> <time_token_23> Cake flour has lower protein content than all purpose flour and that makes the batter to be light and crispy. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> We also add a bit of salt and baking powder. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Another important part of the ingredient is water. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> It has to be very cold. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> We leave a few ice cubes in the water when mixing the batter. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> We also need some vegetable oil for deep frying. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> For the exact measurements and the list of ingredients, please visit our website JapaneseCooking101.com <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Ok, let's begin. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> First we prep everything that we are going to deep fry before making the batter or heating the oil. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Slice the vegetables about a quarter inch thick. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> After peeling and cleaning the shrimp, we want to straighten the shrimp a little bit instead of being all curled up. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> So we make some diagonal cuts on the surface to help straighten. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Even if we do that, it's hard to make it perfect straight when you fry. <time_token_44> <time_token_46> So if you want to skip this process altogether, that's fine too. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Now we have everything ready to go, we can start heating up the oil and preparing the batter. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> In a small bowl, we have some cake flour. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> Add baking powder and salt. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Stir it very well with a whisk. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> You should mix it well now because once you pour the water, you don't want to mix it too much. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> Now pour ice water. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> And here is the most important part. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> Mix only 10 times. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Yes, you should count. <time_token_57> <time_token_60> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> Yes, that's it. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> It doesn't look like it's mixed but that's how you want it. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Don't over mix. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> Here we have some vegetable oil at high temperature at 375 degrees Fahrenheit. <time_token_65> <time_token_68> We dip the vegetables in cold batter and drop it in hot frying oil one by one. <time_token_68> <time_token_71> Don't put too much at a time and you should always start with simple vegetables like green beans or potatoes to keep the oil clean. <time_token_72> <time_token_75> Easy way to see if they are cooked is when you start to see them float on the surface of the oil, sizzling hot. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Then take them out and drain oil on the baking sheet. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> And move on to the next vegetables. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> We are doing eggplant next. <time_token_78> <time_token_80> Before you dip the vegetables in the batter, it's also very important to keep them dry. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> You should wipe or air dry moisture from the vegetables. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> You see the eggplant on the surface and they are ready to come out. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Finally the shrimp. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Drop the shrimp in the hot oil one by one. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> Easiest way to do that is by hand but just be careful. <time_token_85> <time_token_87> As you know, it doesn't take too long to cook shrimp. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> About a few minutes. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> You should see and feel when they are ready. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Now the shrimp is out and it's time to eat. <time_token_90> <time_token_92> You should eat it as soon as it's done while it's still very hot. <time_token_92> <time_token_94> Sprinkle some salt or dip it in the tansu or mensu sauce that you can get a recipe on our website. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> It's so good that you don't even need to go to the restaurant for this.

Dice up a red onion, <time_token_26> <time_token_28> mince a few cloves of garlic, and chop up some cilantro that we're going to add in later. <time_token_29> <time_token_32> Each chef includes some sort of technique or trick with their recipe, and as you learn them, <time_token_32> <time_token_33> eventually you build up your skill set and you can cook whatever you want. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> So the next thing we're going to do is saute the onions and garlic and a little bit of butter. <time_token_37> <time_token_40> Cook these about five to seven minutes until they're soft and kind of translucent. <time_token_44> <time_token_46> Okay, so next we're going to let the onions and the garlic cool down, <time_token_46> <time_token_48> and then we're going to put everything else in a big bowl and smudge it all together. <time_token_48> <time_token_51> We've got some nice hot Italian sausage, some ground beef. We're going to beat two eggs together <time_token_51> <time_token_54> and add those in, and then just some Japanese breadcrumbs and chopped cilantro. <time_token_55> <time_token_58> Then we'll add the cooled off onions and garlic, a little salt, a little pepper. <time_token_59> <time_token_63> So this is the fun part. Another thing we have in this book is essays with short pieces of writing <time_token_63> <time_token_66> from Esquire's amazing writers that are just meant to sort of inspire you to get in the kitchen and <time_token_66> <time_token_69> cook. When everything is all mixed together and you can't see the breadcrumbs anymore, you take <time_token_69> <time_token_72> the whole mixture and you pack it into a meatloaf pan, or you can just make it into a shape that <time_token_72> <time_token_81> looks like a meatloaf and put it on a baking sheet. Into the oven it goes. 375 for 40 minutes. <time_token_93> <time_token_95> Even you couldn't screw it up. It's fantastic.

Today I am making signature Dhaba dish. That's Makki Dal. That's <time_token_1> <time_token_2> Dal Makani. So why it's called Dal Makani? Let me tell you because we will be putting <time_token_2> <time_token_3> butter in this plus we will be using heavy whipping cream in this. So this is like a <time_token_3> <time_token_4> real Punjabi dish. So just wanted to let you guys know that Dal Makani means Dal. That <time_token_4> <time_token_5> is black urad with kidney beans. Chana and duttaal doesn't go in this recipe. So let <time_token_5> <time_token_6> me show you recipe which I have from my childhood and this is my mother's signature dish. Plus <time_token_6> <time_token_7> whenever you will go to Punjab to any Dhaba, that's a Dhaba style dal I am going to present <time_token_7> <time_token_8> to you guys today. So let me introduce you to the ingredients today. Here is dal. You <time_token_8> <time_token_9> will see I have already soaked this dal with some kidney beans. So I have used around <time_token_9> <time_token_11> 1 cup of dal with you can say like half, half, half cup or less than that of kidney beans. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> So not much of kidney beans but this is the dal which I have already soaked for around <time_token_12> <time_token_13> 4-5 hours. So we will be just putting it in pressure cooker and give like 1 or 2 fizzles <time_token_13> <time_token_14> then it would be done. Then what else we need for this is we will be putting some long that's <time_token_14> <time_token_15> cloves in this with some ginger in this. So ginger should be in this way. It should be <time_token_15> <time_token_16> like a string. You can cut with your hands or you can grate it like strings. Then for <time_token_16> <time_token_17> tarka that is for tempering we will be needing some jeera that is cumin seeds, some finely <time_token_17> <time_token_19> chopped fresh garlic, some onions, some cilantro. Then here is the puri. I have already puried <time_token_19> <time_token_20> around 4 tomatoes, 4 medium sized tomatoes. Puri actually gives a nice texture and color <time_token_20> <time_token_21> to the dal maghi. That's the reason we are using puri. And here is my butter. What else <time_token_21> <time_token_22> we need is some salt, some garam masala and some red chilli powder with some heavy whipping <time_token_22> <time_token_23> cream. So ginger I will be using in the pressure cooker. So let's start the process. So whenever <time_token_23> <time_token_24> you soak dal or anything like kidney beans also use that water only to give a pressure <time_token_24> <time_token_25> cooker the dal. Use that water only. Don't take that water out. So I will be using this <time_token_25> <time_token_26> water. So here goes the dal. I have already added cloves in it. So you have to use around <time_token_26> <time_token_28> 8-9 cloves in this. If you want you can use black cardamom, big cardamom. You can use <time_token_28> <time_token_29> that too but I am avoiding this. This is like for daily use. So if it's a party time you <time_token_29> <time_token_29> should use that too. It will give a nice flavor. So here goes dal. It's around 1 cup <time_token_29> <time_token_30> of dal I would say and around 3 cups of water in it. And here goes ginger. So you have to <time_token_30> <time_token_32> use ginger this way only. And some oil in this. Some people put turmeric in this but <time_token_32> <time_token_33> signature dal dish of Punjab doesn't have any turmeric in it. So maki dal that is dal <time_token_33> <time_token_34> makani no turmeric in it. So here let me close the cooker and I will just put it on <time_token_34> <time_token_36> a high flame and I will put it on a high flame and will give it a whistle 2 or 3 whistles <time_token_36> <time_token_36> then it will be done. In the meanwhile I will just start making turka of this dal. Here <time_token_36> <time_token_37> goes my butter about 2 tbsp of water. Let it get melted then we will be using ginger <time_token_37> <time_token_38> and all. Don't let it brown so I will be using some cumin seeds. Cumin seeds actually <time_token_38> <time_token_39> it's optional so I will not be using much of cumin seeds in this. Ginger I have already <time_token_39> <time_token_40> put in my pressure cooker and you can see it's already on a high heat here. We will <time_token_40> <time_token_41> not be wasting time. We will be making turka in the meanwhile our dal is getting pressure <time_token_41> <time_token_43> cooker so my cumin seeds are done. Here goes the garlic. So use around 1 tbsp of garlic. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Be generous in making a turka because Punjabi turkas if you will see my other recipes you <time_token_44> <time_token_45> will see Punjabi turkas are always we use a lot of turka like and here goes my onions. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> So I am using around 1 medium sized onion. So that's the reason I am again saying we <time_token_46> <time_token_47> have to be generous in using all the things in this. My garlic is done. Here goes onions. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Just stir it for until it's like golden brown. The onions are done. So here goes my freshly <time_token_49> <time_token_51> done tomato fury. So I am using around 4 medium sized tomatoes. It's like you have <time_token_51> <time_token_52> more quantity of dal so you can put more tomatoes in this. So I will just cover this with a <time_token_52> <time_token_54> lid and give it like 5 minutes and once it will exert oil from it then it's done. It's <time_token_54> <time_token_55> around like 5 to 7 minutes and you can see it has already lost the it has started losing <time_token_55> <time_token_56> oil from it. That means it's done. So masala should be properly done. So now I am going <time_token_56> <time_token_57> to put some salt in it. Salt according to your taste. I will be using around 1 teaspoon <time_token_57> <time_token_58> of salt. Some red chilli powder. If you want you can use more. I don't use much and you <time_token_58> <time_token_60> can use green chillies also. In the meanwhile my just cooker will be getting whistle. As <time_token_60> <time_token_61> my cooker have just got a whistle I can get the aroma of ginger and cloves from my Maaki <time_token_61> <time_token_62> dal. That's just nothing. It's just getting boiled. So once you will make this way you <time_token_62> <time_token_63> will get that aroma from this dal. So my masala is almost done. I will just give one more <time_token_63> <time_token_64> whistle to my dal and then I will just put the dal in the tarka. Let me see how my dal <time_token_64> <time_token_65> looks like. Look at the texture. Look at the kidney beans over here. It's some ginger over <time_token_65> <time_token_66> this. So we are just going to take this dal and put it in my saucepan in which I have <time_token_66> <time_token_68> already done the tampering. So I have just put all the dal in this and I will just keep <time_token_68> <time_token_69> it on between medium to high heat for around 15-20 minutes. The actual way of making dal <time_token_69> <time_token_70> in Punjab is we keep this in the morning and it will be done by the evening. So what we <time_token_70> <time_token_71> call it as in Punjabi is karna. Karna means we have to put it on a slow or between low heat <time_token_71> <time_token_72> and let it cook you know slowly steadily and gives a nice flavor and color till evening. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> But yeah if you want a good texture keep this after putting a tempering and all this keep this <time_token_73> <time_token_74> for around one hour or so to get a royal taste. But I'll not be taking much time. I'll give like <time_token_74> <time_token_75> 15-20 minutes and I'll just cover this with a lid and let it cook on medium heat for a while. <time_token_75> <time_token_77> It's around 15 minutes till yet and it's still on like medium heat and I'll just give like 15 <time_token_77> <time_token_78> more minutes to get professional dal which is like kadiwi dal. So what I'll do is right now <time_token_78> <time_token_79> to get a good texture I'll be using the spatula and I'll be mashing some dal this way. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> So this will give a very nice texture to the dal and this is the way the dhaba people make <time_token_80> <time_token_82> dal in Punjab. So you can use the masher but we are not mashing whole dal but we are mashing <time_token_82> <time_token_83> like somewhat dal in this. So it will give a thick gravy also and adds value and adds flavor <time_token_83> <time_token_84> to the dal. So I'll just cover it with a lid for another 15 minutes. Check back in 15 minutes <time_token_84> <time_token_85> because I want to show you guys a professional royal dal makhani. Dal is like on slow cooking <time_token_85> <time_token_86> for around 30 minutes now. Look at the texture, look at the color. So this is the consistency <time_token_86> <time_token_87> of the dal which we actually need and which we actually have in the dhabas. So now it's <time_token_87> <time_token_88> the time to just turn off the heat and use your heavy whipping cream. First I'll be using some <time_token_88> <time_token_89> cilantro. Here goes some cilantro and now put some heavy whipping cream. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Use as much as you can, you know, because that adds a rich flavor to the dal. Just stir this. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> And we are done. So you can see the rich creamy color in the dal. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Here goes dal makhani, rich creamy dal makhani Punjabi dish.

is just, if you need to thicken it up a little bit, just add a little bit of flour in there <time_token_13> <time_token_14> like so, a little spoonful of that, and just mix that all around and it will just help <time_token_14> <time_token_14> starting to thicken up so you've got a nice thick sauce. <time_token_14> <time_token_16> Ok the next stage, put the onion in, because it's been grated obviously it's not going <time_token_16> <time_token_17> to take that long to cook and we've got the garlic in, we'll just sort of mix that around <time_token_17> <time_token_18> and again do the same with the carrot, so you've got a good selection of things here, <time_token_18> <time_token_19> I mean obviously you can add things to taste, I mean you can add some peas in, whatever <time_token_19> <time_token_20> you like, so we'll get that all in there, give that a stir, got that all stirred up <time_token_20> <time_token_21> and cooking for nearly a minute, just put a bit of, this is the old Worcester sauce, <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Lee Perrins sort of Worcester sauce, so put a good splash of that in, and also want a <time_token_22> <time_token_24> bit of tomato puree, so again we'll just put a splodge of that, give that a quick stir, <time_token_24> <time_token_25> I mean you can always add it to taste, I might just put a little bit more puree in there, <time_token_25> <time_token_26> see another good squirt of that, add a bit of red wine, don't go overboard, and give <time_token_26> <time_token_28> that a good stir up, now I'm also at this stage going to add a bit of rosemary and some <time_token_28> <time_token_29> thyme, I've already got it sort of chopped up there quite fine, so just going to sprinkle <time_token_29> <time_token_31> that on, gives it a nice flavour, we don't need to cook this very long, probably at the <time_token_31> <time_token_32> stage really we can add a little bit of chicken stock, just trying to make sure the red wine's <time_token_32> <time_token_33> mixed in and there's no liquid sort of there of red wine, just get it all there, and see <time_token_33> <time_token_34> it's looking a really good colour though, I'm just going to add a little bit of chicken <time_token_34> <time_token_35> stock, I mean you can use lamb stock if you want, but I'm just going to use a bit of chicken <time_token_35> <time_token_37> stock, I think it gives it a nice flavour, just going to stir that really on a low heat <time_token_37> <time_token_38> I would say now for about a minute and just try and get that to thicken up nicely, now <time_token_38> <time_token_39> we've got to start doing the mashed potato, so that's going to be our next stage, so I'll <time_token_39> <time_token_40> just leave that cooking there for about a minute and we're probably ready to go, before <time_token_40> <time_token_42> I add the mashed potato into the pan things, you want to try the baits first and see what <time_token_42> <time_token_43> it's like, mine's good, you've got all those, the rosemary, it's all coming through, I did <time_token_43> <time_token_44> add just a tad more salt and pepper to my one, and a tiny little bit of chicken stock <time_token_44> <time_token_45> extra, I mean obviously the sauce and that, you can have it as you like, if you like it <time_token_45> <time_token_46> slightly thicker then do it as I've done it, if you like it a little bit more runny like <time_token_46> <time_token_47> a grave you just add a little bit more chicken stock, so that's ready to go now, so we're <time_token_47> <time_token_48> going to put it into a little ceramic pot and then we're going to put the mashed potato <time_token_48> <time_token_49> on top, it's got me potatoes done, these are just sort of white potatoes actually, any <time_token_49> <time_token_50> potato would do, so we're just going to make the mashed potato, I'm just cutting it up <time_token_50> <time_token_51> so that then I can sort of place some butter in there, try and make it so really it sticks <time_token_51> <time_token_52> on the spoon when you lift it up, so it's all mashed up, you put your spoon in there <time_token_52> <time_token_53> and it sort of hangs there really, that's how you want it, you don't want it too runny <time_token_53> <time_token_54> otherwise it will just sort of disappear into the mince and stuff, so I'm going to use the <time_token_54> <time_token_55> mashing thing for that and just mash that up now, I've got my mashed potato ready and <time_token_55> <time_token_56> you can see that it pretty much hangs on the spoon there, if you give it much so, that's <time_token_56> <time_token_57> nice thick mashed potato really, so that's good. Now the other little ingredient which <time_token_57> <time_token_58> is up to you whether you add or not, but I mean I really like it on there, it's a bit <time_token_58> <time_token_59> of parmesan cheese, grated parmesan cheese, so you can mix that in with the mash, so we'll <time_token_59> <time_token_60> just give that a quick stir and the other thing again to add to this really is a little <time_token_60> <time_token_62> bit more salt, again do that to taste and a little bit of pepper and then really we're <time_token_62> <time_token_63> ready to put the two together, so I'll now show you you know just putting the two together <time_token_63> <time_token_64> and we're going to put it in the oven and it's ready to cook, just put the mince in <time_token_64> <time_token_66> here, that's it and then we're going to level that out a little bit and then simply just <time_token_66> <time_token_67> put the mashed potato over the top, before I do I'm just going to sneak a few peas in <time_token_67> <time_token_68> here, just give it a bit of colour and I know my kids like the peas and stuff so I can get <time_token_68> <time_token_69> away with that, so just put the mashed potato on, try and spread it over so it sort of seals <time_token_69> <time_token_70> itself up really, you get it right up to the edges and push it down so it's nicely on top, <time_token_70> <time_token_71> got all the mash sorted out, it's sealed up round the edges so that's nice, now what I've <time_token_71> <time_token_72> got here is a little bit of grated cheese, this is just normal mature sort of cheddar, <time_token_72> <time_token_73> so you can just sprinkle some of that on top of there, use a fork just to kind of rough <time_token_73> <time_token_74> this up a little bit and it gets some of the cheese in there as well, because all these <time_token_74> <time_token_75> little fluffy bits you create, they're the bits that go brown and give it the effect, <time_token_75> <time_token_76> so like that and again a little bit more cheese, just a bubble on top, now we're going to put <time_token_76> <time_token_78> this in the oven for about 20 minutes, I'd say around about 220-240 degrees so it looks <time_token_78> <time_token_79> brown, what you've got to remember is it's all cooked, we're just now browning off the <time_token_79> <time_token_80> top and making it look nice, the last thing just to do is just dig it with a fork there <time_token_80> <time_token_81> like so and I think it just lets some of the steam out so it doesn't overflow so much, <time_token_81> <time_token_82> so pop that like so, ready to go in the oven, I'm just going to pull this out now, I've <time_token_82> <time_token_83> actually left it a little bit longer so it's been in there about 22-23 minutes and you <time_token_83> <time_token_84> can see that you've got a nice little browned off top and let's have a look at it, I'll <time_token_84> <time_token_85> put it on the table and serve a piece up, let's have a look what's inside, okay I've <time_token_85> <time_token_86> got the shepherd's pie there, I'm just going to make a little cut with a knife there to <time_token_86> <time_token_88> start with and then what I'm going to do is just use a spoon here, a big spoon and serve <time_token_88> <time_token_90> this up, I mean this is, I don't know if you can see that but this is lovely and moist <time_token_90> <time_token_91> and you've got a nice sort of crispy coating on the top there and then what we can do is <time_token_91> <time_token_92> serve this up with a little bit of extra gravy if you want and maybe a few peas which is <time_token_92> <time_token_94> what I think I'll do, okay I'm just going to put a few peas just alongside there like <time_token_94> <time_token_96> so and maybe a little bit of gravy just to finish it off and I might as well as always <time_token_96> <time_token_98> do the taste test, I love the rosemary in it, you

Here's what I got to start. <time_token_1> <time_token_5> Look at these beautiful potato rolls right here. You want to make sure you get yourself a nice roll. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> I'm going to start with these rolls. Next, I went to the deli and got some <time_token_8> <time_token_9> American cheese. If you're going to go good, why not go the best? <time_token_9> <time_token_11> Of course, here I got some ground round. Let's get started. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> Alright, so what I've done here is laid down a double layer of aluminum foil. <time_token_13> <time_token_15> If you have the really thick stuff, you can use one, but unfortunately I don't right now. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> So, the next step is to take your ground beef. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> Now you're making the sliders, so what you want to do is <time_token_20> <time_token_21> take your ground beef, kind of lift it up a little bit, <time_token_23> <time_token_24> and smooth it out. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> You want to make sure it doesn't really stick. You're just kind of <time_token_26> <time_token_28> smoothing it out to the point to where you're going to cut it into little square patties. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> Once you've got it all flattened out, and you can use a rolling pin, just use it lightly. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> I would recommend using wax paper instead of foil, but I don't have that. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Not a problem. You can still use it. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> It will come off, but wax paper is better because it slides off easier. <time_token_39> <time_token_41> What you're doing now is that you've made it flat enough, is you're making those actual <time_token_41> <time_token_43> beautifully thin slider patties. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> You don't want them too thick, otherwise you're just eating a small, thick burger. <time_token_44> <time_token_46> If you like it that way, go with it, but this is for sliders. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> So here we go. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> Take a knife, <time_token_47> <time_token_48> and just start taking the edges like that. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> Now you can use the extra meat to go ahead and reform it out and make more patties, so <time_token_51> <time_token_52> don't think that you're wasting any meat. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> As you go along, <time_token_53> <time_token_53> gently use your knife, <time_token_54> <time_token_55> and start cutting the edges, and moving it aside. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Alright, I'm going to finish this, and I'll get back to you in a moment. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> And here's a basic idea of what it looks like. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Just simple square patties. You can salt them now. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> I prefer to salt them after they come off, <time_token_63> <time_token_64> salt usually falls off. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> So now you want to just toast those buns. Put them under your broiler for like <time_token_66> <time_token_67> 30 seconds to a minute, <time_token_67> <time_token_68> depending on how high you have the rack, and how <time_token_69> <time_token_72> strong your broiler is. But look how beautiful it looks. Alright, so we got the burgers ready. Let's put them on the pan here. <time_token_72> <time_token_75> I'm going to use the pan to run 4.5 to 5 for a few minutes. <time_token_75> <time_token_77> Give it a little flier burgers there. Very nice. See you in a moment. <time_token_79> <time_token_81> Alright, so I've got one side done. Moving it around. Beautiful. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> Now, our nicely cut cheese. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> Kind of cut it a little bigger than those patties there. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Yummy, yummy. There you go. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> There's your sliders. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> Let's finish them off really quick with the bun. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> Go to Beadaholique.com for all of your beading supplies needs!

It's spicy, it's hot, and it's a traditional Sichuan dish. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> It's definitely one of my favorite things to eat. And you know, according to the legend, <time_token_4> <time_token_6> Mahapu Tofu is invented by Chen Chiao-Chiao because she has pork marred on her face, <time_token_6> <time_token_8> so people start naming it Mahapu Tofu, which means pork marred, grandma's bean curve. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> And now let's get started with this dish. <time_token_11> <time_token_13> Okay, so here are the ingredients from Mahapu Tofu. We have stuffed tofu, cut it into cubes, <time_token_13> <time_token_16> and we have minced beef. Here we have some salt, sugar, pepper, Sichuan pepper, corn powder, <time_token_16> <time_token_18> a little bit of Sesame oil, Sichuan pepper, corn oil, and there's dark soy sauce, there's hot <time_token_18> <time_token_20> oil, there's chili bean paste, there's garlic, ginger, and cornstarch water, and some scallions. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> Oh, and also a cup of water. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> So you may be wondering how to use stir-fry tofu. Here's the trick. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> When you, before you want to stir-fry tofu, you can boil the hot water, boil the tofu for about <time_token_25> <time_token_26> 30 seconds. You're gonna make a pinch of salt, and this way you're gonna make the tofu more durable <time_token_26> <time_token_29> and harder in texture. So now we're just gonna do this.

<time_token_3> <time_token_4> I am Bauna and today I am making hot sweet and sour soup. <time_token_4> <time_token_4> Yes, it's a combination of hot spicy sweet sour. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> This is the Indo-Chinese fusion, which is a very quick way of making it. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> So here I have the pot and into the pot I am going to add the olive oil. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> You can use any one you are using in the cooking. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> But the olive oil enhances the flavor of the soup. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> You can make either hot and sour or sweet and sour. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> But I kind of like combination of hot, sweet and sour. <time_token_9> <time_token_9> So this oil is there and here I have some vegetables that I have thinly sliced. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> This all vegetables so that it cooks fast. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> I have the green bell pepper, carrot, onion. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> I am using red onion but you can use any onion you have and I have the cabbage. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> Now for the vegetables, the list goes on and on. <time_token_12> <time_token_12> You can use any vegetables that you like. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> The endless possibilities for adding vegetables. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Here I have the minced ginger and garlic and I have here the noodles. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> I am using the instant noodles because this soup is going to be quick soup. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> And this instant noodles is what it is that I usually buy from Indian grocery. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> It's actually the curry, the brand is top ramen curry and it's a spicy, tasty, it comes <time_token_17> <time_token_17> with the spices. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> I am not going to use the spices but I am just showing. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> So I am using this instant noodles and here I have my all sauces and everything. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> So we are going to start adding first vegetables. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> I have the pot, into the pot the first goes onion and carrot, bell pepper and here I have <time_token_22> <time_token_22> this cabbage, very thin cabbage you can see that. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> So all the vegetables cook at the same time and we don't want to overcook all our vegetables. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> On a medium heat and give it a quick stir, add just a pinch of salt. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> Here I have the vinegar and to this vegetable I am going to add this noodles and here I <time_token_27> <time_token_28> have the vegetable broth, one cup, give it a stir. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> You can use water instead of vegetable broth or stock but if you want a real flavourful <time_token_29> <time_token_30> soup then always use the vegetable broth or stock. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> Here I have the minced garlic and ginger, here I have the soy sauce about a tablespoon <time_token_32> <time_token_32> oh that's all I have actually. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Hot sauce, mine is not that much hot so I am using about half a teaspoon but you can <time_token_33> <time_token_33> adjust your taste. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Here is my sweet and sour sauce, you can use as much as you want because it has nice taste. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> So I am going to add about a couple of tablespoon, give it a stir. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Now you can increase the temperature again to a little bit higher, medium to high. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> I am also going to add sesame seeds oil, nice flavour, just a little bit not too much. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Now you want to bring this to a rapid boil so I am going to cover it, aroma is now so <time_token_39> <time_token_41> So I am going to let it boil a little bit, here I have this to make this soup thick I <time_token_41> <time_token_42> am using today arrowroot powder, I have only shared if you want to make the gravy or any <time_token_42> <time_token_43> sauce or any soup, if you want to make it little thicker you can use the corn starch <time_token_43> <time_token_43> or the arrowroot powder. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Now if you ask me the question which one is the better then I would say arrowroot powder <time_token_44> <time_token_44> because it's more healthy to use arrowroot powder. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> It also gives the shine to any recipe and little glow that you see like that's why this <time_token_45> <time_token_46> is the most chef you prefer to use arrowroot powder or corn starch. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> So I have here the arrowroot powder that I am going to use to make this thick, to make <time_token_47> <time_token_48> this soup little thick. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Now my intent to make this soup is sometimes I would like to eat lots of tofu and sometimes <time_token_49> <time_token_50> I would like to eat boiled egg or anything that can add little protein to your diet. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> That's where this soup comes in, for me I mean you can use any time you want but that's <time_token_51> <time_token_51> what it is. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Usually if I have to eat tofu I can't eat just as it is, I have to add lot of spices <time_token_52> <time_token_53> to it otherwise I can't eat the tofu and I would love to add that to my diet. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> So these are some of the ways that I have found that I can eat tofu and the vegetables <time_token_55> <time_token_55> sometimes I love to eat mushrooms. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> So I add lot of mushrooms to this soup. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> So anything that you can think of you can just have your own imagination, your own creation <time_token_57> <time_token_57> and you will love this soup however you make it. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> Alright so this is coming to the boil, at this time I am going to add this arrowroot <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Now this arrowroot powder you can simply add directly into any recipe. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> You don't have to dissolve into the water just like a corn starch that you have to do. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> So I am going to bring it down to the low again and look at this soup already looks <time_token_61> <time_token_64> nice color so I am ready to add this arrowroot powder and quickly try to stir and this will <time_token_64> <time_token_64> make the soup thick. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> See how it's getting thicker quickly, look at that. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> So if you want to add the boiled egg, what I normally do I boil the egg in a separate <time_token_66> <time_token_67> pot and then cut into pieces and I add those pieces into the soup. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> You can simply use paneer even if you want paneer but if you are looking for healthy <time_token_68> <time_token_69> diet then tofu or the boiled egg is the best option. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> And of course vegetables are out there, any vegetables that you like. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> Here I have the tofu now, I was trying to cut very thin so the pieces don't look good <time_token_72> <time_token_72> but that's okay. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> So into my soup, the soup looks perfect, that tofu, you can add as much as you want. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> So look at this soup, I am going to just cook a little bit since I added the tofu now. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> And the final thing I have left is the spring onion, the green onion or the scallion that <time_token_76> <time_token_76> I usually sprinkle on the top. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> You can also add while you cook other vegetables. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> But I kind of like the raw taste of it and let's see how the soup is doing, gorgeous. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> Looks so yummy. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> So I have my own bowl and that's just for me. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> So this all soup is for me. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> This whole pot is for me. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> I am going to take out into my bowl, very hot and that is what you want. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> And on the top, here I have the chopped green onion. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> You can use the finely chopped cilantro if you don't have the green onion. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> My soup bowl looks so yummy, I can't wait to try. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> Sometimes I also add the garbanzo beans because all I want is just protein with all the vegetables <time_token_87> <time_token_90> and I really love this soup and it's hot. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Usually I make the vegetable spring rolls to go with this soup but today it was just <time_token_91> <time_token_92> So I got lazy and I just made the soup and this is just all for me. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> So I am about the hot sweet and I will see you real soon with the next great recipe.

In this kind of weather one of my favorite recipes to make is minestrone because it is such <time_token_7> <time_token_9> a good way to have every color of the rainbow in vegetables all in one delicious warming soup <time_token_9> <time_token_10> and I wanted to share with you my recipe for it because I think it is such a great <time_token_10> <time_token_12> warming dinner. It also makes an amazing easy lunch that I never get tired of which is so <time_token_12> <time_token_13> important if you're going to be eating something repeatedly throughout the week because you made <time_token_13> <time_token_14> a huge batch. So that's exactly what I'm going to show you how to do tonight. We're going to make <time_token_14> <time_token_16> minestrone together so if you'd like to know how to make that delicious healthy soup then keep <time_token_16> <time_token_18> watching. So to make my version of minestrone you will need the following ingredients from left to <time_token_18> <time_token_20> right, four or five large carrots, a couple of parsnips, four cloves of garlic, a couple of stalks <time_token_20> <time_token_22> of celery, I'm using three, a large bunch of kale, a box of pasta, you're only going to need about half <time_token_22> <time_token_24> of the box if you're making a very large batch of soup that is still plenty. I'm using cut <time_token_24> <time_token_26> macaroni although traditionally you would actually use ditalini, I just don't have any on hand. Then <time_token_26> <time_token_28> you'll need a wedge of parmesan including the rind, a large onion, some crushed tomatoes, beans of <time_token_28> <time_token_29> your choice, I'm using kidney and pinto, then you'll need some stock and some red chili flakes <time_token_29> <time_token_31> if you like a little spice to your life. As well as the obvious salt and pepper, the spices I like <time_token_31> <time_token_33> to use in minestrone or turmeric which is really great for you. It's a great anti-inflammatory <time_token_33> <time_token_35> paprika which adds a really nice little smoky hint, some thyme, I don't have any fresh so I'm <time_token_35> <time_token_37> using dried and some fresh rosemary from my balcony. All right so as I hope you guys can <time_token_37> <time_token_39> hear from that sizzling sound I'm now frying up my aromatic vegetables so that's my celery, <time_token_39> <time_token_41> my carrots, onion, garlic and also the parsnips since I have it, might as well stir fry it with <time_token_41> <time_token_43> the rest. The only tip that I would give you guys is for the kale and any other sort of leafy greens <time_token_43> <time_token_45> that you might add to your minestrone, do not add it now, do not even add it when you add your beans <time_token_45> <time_token_46> or your tomatoes or your broth which I'm just going to show you all of those steps once this is <time_token_46> <time_token_48> fried up and softened up a little bit. You don't want to add the greens until the last minute <time_token_48> <time_token_49> because otherwise they will lose all of their flavor and color and kind of turn brown and gross <time_token_49> <time_token_51> and horrible. You really just want to wilt the greens in the soup for maybe about 10 minutes <time_token_51> <time_token_53> so I'll show you guys that step when we get to it. To my fried vegetable mixture I'm going to <time_token_53> <time_token_55> add my crushed tomatoes and I'm making a mess on my spoon because I am looking at this through a <time_token_55> <time_token_57> viewfinder. Beauty guru problems, you guys will not have this problem when you are making this, <time_token_57> <time_token_59> I promise. I'm also going to rinse off the can of tomato with water after but I don't have a hand <time_token_59> <time_token_61> to do that because I'm holding the camera. Then I'm going to add my first can of beans which I <time_token_61> <time_token_62> have rinsed really really well, you definitely want to make sure that you do that. I'm going to dump <time_token_62> <time_token_65> my generous parmesan rind in there and make sure you fish that out at the end. I like to nibble on <time_token_65> <time_token_66> it because I'm strange like that and it's delicious and then I'm going to add to this mixture <time_token_66> <time_token_69> simultaneously rinsing off my spoon. I know I'm so smart. About 10 cups of liquid or until you feel <time_token_69> <time_token_71> like it's perfect for you. Depends how much liquid you want in your broth and how thick you want it <time_token_71> <time_token_73> if you want it more of like a soupy kind of consistency or more of a stew like consistency. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> So my soup has simmered for about two hours which is a really good amount. You can do a little bit <time_token_75> <time_token_76> less or a little bit more a lot depends on how tender you would like your carrots and I've washed <time_token_76> <time_token_78> and torn up my kale and removed all of the stems the middle parts because that's really tough and <time_token_78> <time_token_80> you don't want that in your soup or anything really for the most part. You can see this looks <time_token_80> <time_token_81> like a lot but it's really going to wilt down into the soup and plus it's good for you. I would <time_token_81> <time_token_83> struggle to eat this much kale if it wasn't all wilted and in a soup. So I'm going to add that <time_token_84> <time_token_86> and I actually just like to add my pasta at the same time so I have my elbow pasta right here <time_token_86> <time_token_87> and I'm going to add about half of the box so I guess that's about 250 grams into the soup and <time_token_87> <time_token_89> it'll just absorb all the delicious flavors as it's cooking and then I'll show you guys my bowl <time_token_89> <time_token_91> once it's ready. So there is the finished product. I think it looks pretty yummy. You guys can see <time_token_91> <time_token_92> the steam rising off of it dramatically. I really enjoyed sharing this recipe with you. It's one of <time_token_92> <time_token_94> my favorite staples for an easy fall and winter dinner or lunch and it travels to the office <time_token_94> <time_token_96> really really well and it's just so warming and comforting and full of a lot of different veggies <time_token_96> <time_token_97> which is great for you. Thank you so much for coming to hang out with me in the kitchen today <time_token_97> <time_token_98> for my Meal Mondays series and I will see you guys in my next video. Bye!

I have Zenedine Zidane's World Cup Jersey <time_token_2> <time_token_4> for France. And today's dish is penne vodka. It's a tomato and cream sauce with <time_token_4> <time_token_5> a vodka reduction, which is a fairly popular dish in Italy and on the menu of <time_token_5> <time_token_6> American Italian restaurants, one of my favorite dishes. First time I made it was <time_token_6> <time_token_7> just the other day and I'm going to attempt to duplicate that because it <time_token_7> <time_token_8> turned out really well. It's a very easy dish, as you'll soon see. It's very <time_token_8> <time_token_9> simple. One or two, three steps, something like that. Okay, for the ingredients you <time_token_9> <time_token_10> will need a couple of cups of tomato sauce. This is my homemade tomato sauce. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> It's just like the recipe I have on my channel here somewhere. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> If you don't have tomato sauce in your repertoire of dishes to cook, you need to <time_token_13> <time_token_15> work on that. Some penne, pasta, pancetta. As we say in Spain, <time_token_15> <time_token_17> pancetta. I have a little bit of jamon, Spanish ham, parmesan cheese, some cream, <time_token_17> <time_token_18> vodka is the name implies. I've already started some water to boil for the pasta <time_token_18> <time_token_20> and a little something for me, you know, for the effort. Some nice olives that I've <time_token_20> <time_token_21> got picked up from my halal butcher shop. I just found out they have tremendous <time_token_21> <time_token_23> olives there. And a glass of wine from Utiel Requena here in Valencia community. <time_token_23> <time_token_26> Put the water on to boil. Aggressively salted as Mario Batali says. I just put a <time_token_26> <time_token_27> couple drops of olive oil in it too just because, just because, just because I put <time_token_27> <time_token_29> olive oil in everything I eat now. Okay, got the water hot so the pasta will be <time_token_29> <time_token_31> quick to cook. Now I'm heating the pan up. We're cooking the pasta dish in. I like my <time_token_31> <time_token_32> big, you can use a skillet, but I really like this big deep pan because at the end <time_token_32> <time_token_34> I'm gonna be mixing the pasta in with it. So heating up some olive oil. Just a bit <time_token_34> <time_token_35> of olive oil because we're gonna get quite a bit of fat in me. The pancetta <time_token_35> <time_token_36> that I kind of cut up rather, rather well just so it's nice manageable pieces. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> So this into the pot. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> Cook this down. <time_token_39> <time_token_42> The Spanish ham is pretty well cooked so I just need to go in at the end. So we'll just render this nice fatty pancetta down. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Basically the reason you're using this is because of the nice fat content. You can <time_token_44> <time_token_45> also cook this dish with shrimp or seafood or all this about anything else. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> If you could use the pork product, why wouldn't you? <time_token_48> <time_token_50> Okay, so the pancetta has rendered down pretty well. I'll add the ham. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> The pancetta doesn't really need to cook, I'll just add it in. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Now comes the tricky part. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> I'm gonna add the vodka. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> I'm gonna be careful because it's made to lay them up. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> So if I might have to throw out the camera and help with the fire department. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Then all I want to do is deglaze the pan with this. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> Turn up the heat. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> Now that will flame the vodka. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> I don't really think that's necessary because the heat does the same thing as just flaming the vodka. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> Okay, so I've added the tomato sauce. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> Let that come up to temperature. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> Next step will be to add some heavy cream. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Not quite ready yet. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> See the other pastas. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Come on nicely. You want to cook this a little less than usual. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> If you go for al dente, a little less than al dente because you're going to cook it in the sauce for a while. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> That will cook the pasta, so you don't want to get it mushy. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> As you may have noticed, I haven't added any seasoning to this. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> You could add a little bit of red pepper, but I haven't put any salt in because the ham has salt. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> There's a little bit of salt in my tomato sauce. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> But as I just gave it a little taste test, it doesn't need anything. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> Actually, it's very good just as it is. <time_token_75> <time_token_77> Now I'll just add, for this, I'm going to add some peas just for a little bit of color. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> And just give it a little more body, I guess, texture and color. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> A little more added nutrients too. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Now the cheese you can either add with the sauce or just on each individual dish, which is what I prefer to do. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> I don't like adding it to the sauce. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> People don't like it, they don't have to put cheese on it. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> I've got to cook it out of the pasta. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> We drain that and throw that in with the pasta, or the sauce. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> I've mixed the pasta with the sauce. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> I used a half a kilo of penne, so it's a big batch. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> But because I made it the other day, I knew just about how much sauce I wanted. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Very Italian sauce ratio. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Not too much sauce. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> A lot of people drown their pasta in sauce. <time_token_92> <time_token_94> Or the Italian way is just to just cover it and just let this heat up a little bit. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> It'd actually probably turn this off pretty soon. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> We're going to plate it up and add cheese and we're ready to serve. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> I've plated up the dish with a bit of fresh parmesan cheese grated on top. <time_token_98> <time_token_98> And that is penne a la vodka.

Now the next thing I'm going to work on is the flour. <time_token_14> <time_token_16> Now I'm using plain flour but what I'm going to do is put a little bit of salt and a little bit of pepper. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Really if you can season it all the way through it really adds to the flavour. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> Put a good bit of salt and pepper in there, just give it a light stir and that's ready for dipping the fish in. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> I'm going to move that aside and then what we're going to do is get on with the batter mix. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Now to make the batter mix it's really very simple. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> Again you should use a bit of plain flour. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> With the flour again put a bit of salt and pepper seasoning because all the way through you want to season your food. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> So the next ingredient to go in is the fizzy water, so just spring water. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> The bubbles really make it a lot better so put a little bit then. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> I'm going to use a whisk for actually whisking it up. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> I can tell straight away we need more of the water in there. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Just whisk this up until you get it all nicely mixed up and try and get the lumps out. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> I think we need a little bit more flour in there. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> It's starting to look about right now, just thicken up slightly anyway. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> So I'm going to get on with the cooking. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Now I've got a non-stick frying pan now and I'm just going to put some oil. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> I'm just going to use normal sunflower oil but you want to put a fair amount because you need to cook the fish really. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> I mean obviously if you've got a deep fat fryer then great but I haven't got one of those. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> So I'm just going to let that get hot because the pan is getting really nice and hot now. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> I can see all those sort of bubbles forming at the bottom there. <time_token_45> <time_token_47> So I'm just going to put the flour all round the fish, try and get it everywhere. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Give it a shake off and then what you do is drop it into the batter mix. <time_token_48> <time_token_50> And then when you've got the hot oil just drop it in right slow. <time_token_50> <time_token_52> And put them in slowly because it allows the batter to actually form a crust. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> If you put it in too quick it cools the oil down. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> I'm just going to do three actually, keep it simple. <time_token_54> <time_token_56> And we're going to put a little bit of oil on top just to get a bit of a crust so we can flip them over. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Now I've got the fish in there, turn it down to a sort of medium heat rather than the very high. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> So we've got it on about a medium heat and what I'm doing is just scratching a little bit of oil <time_token_60> <time_token_63> so that when we turn it over you know the outside is all nice and encapsulated and the fish is cooking inside and it's going to be really delicious. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> So I'm just going to cook this for about two minutes on this side and then we're going to flip it over for another two minutes. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> And what we're looking to do is to get a nice golden brown colour, nice crispy coating. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> Now I've been cooking for a couple of minutes, I'm going to turn these over and then I might turn them over just one more time at the end. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> You see, they're starting to look really nice, thick golden brown. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> So I just carry on cooking these for two minutes on this side and then we'll flip them over one more time. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> So total cook time really is about five minutes on a medium heat. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> So I've been cooking for about four minutes, just going to whip those over. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> And really just cook this side until it's nice and brown on the bottom and you're ready to serve up. <time_token_79> <time_token_82> To finish cooking mine, what I'm going to do is take them off and I'm just going to place them on a little bit of paper tissue just to let them drain off. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> So when you serve them up, they're not all oily. Look at that, lovely. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> I'm going to serve them up now. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> I'm going to serve these up. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> I've got some really nice crispy homemade fries that I've made. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> You see, you've got a really nice coating there. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> You can tell the crunchiness. This is great.

Today I'm going to show you how to make this <time_token_1> <time_token_2> delicious chicken parmesan. This is one of those dishes that sounds a lot more complicated than it <time_token_2> <time_token_3> really is, but it's really simple. These are the ingredients that you'll need, so let's get started. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> I'm going to start off with two boneless, skinless chicken breasts here, <time_token_5> <time_token_6> and these have been de-thawed. And using a knife, I'm just going to trim off the gristly parts and <time_token_6> <time_token_7> the excess fat, maybe some of the skin that's left over on there. Just kind of trim them up <time_token_7> <time_token_9> and clean them up a little bit. Then I'm going to cut that breast right in half, <time_token_9> <time_token_11> set those off onto a plate, and then trim up and clean up my second chicken breast. <time_token_12> <time_token_12> Now I've got a piece of wax paper here, and I put that onto my cutting board, <time_token_12> <time_token_14> and I made it long enough so I can fold it over on itself. And I'm just going to use a small cup <time_token_14> <time_token_16> here, and I'm going to pound out my breast halves until they're about a half an inch thick or so. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Now you can use anything heavy that you want to use. If you have a meat mallet, you can use that. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> I don't happen to have one, so that's why I'm using my small bowl. You can also use the bottom of a <time_token_18> <time_token_20> skillet or a frying pan. You can use a rolling pin, really whatever you have that's relatively <time_token_20> <time_token_21> heavy that you can pound this out with. And when you get them all done, this is what they will look <time_token_21> <time_token_23> like. This should be about a half an inch thick or so, maybe a little bit thinner. And now we can <time_token_23> <time_token_24> start working on our breading ingredients. The first thing I'm going to need is an egg wash. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> So I'm going to take two large eggs and crack those into a bowl. And if you get any shells in <time_token_25> <time_token_26> there, be sure to get those out. Don't want any little crunchy bits in your chicken parmesan. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> And using a fork, I'm just going to whisk these together. In another bowl, I've got about one <time_token_28> <time_token_29> and a half cups of Italian style breadcrumbs. And I'm going to add in a quarter of a cup of <time_token_29> <time_token_31> gridded parmesan cheese. Now I'm using my homemade Italian breadcrumbs here. I will put a link in the <time_token_31> <time_token_32> description box. That will take you to a video that shows how I make those. And then finally, <time_token_32> <time_token_33> in a third bowl, I've got about a half a cup of flour. I'm going to add in a teaspoon of salt <time_token_33> <time_token_35> and a half a teaspoon of ground black pepper. I'm just going to mix this together. And now we can <time_token_35> <time_token_36> start breading our chicken. Now the breading process is really simple on this. You just want <time_token_36> <time_token_37> to take one of your powdered out pieces of chicken and dredge it in the flour mixture. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> Shake off the excess and then put it into your eggs. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> And then you want to let the excess drip off. And then you want to go right into your breadcrumbs. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Then you want to take your breadcrumbs and kind of push them into your chicken there. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> And that'll make sure that you get a nice thick coating on your chicken. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> And when you get that completely coated, go ahead and set it off onto a plate. <time_token_44> <time_token_46> And then continue breading the rest of your chicken. And once all your chicken is breaded, <time_token_46> <time_token_47> you want to let this sit and let that coating kind of adhere to the chicken <time_token_47> <time_token_48> for about 15 minutes or so before you cook them up. I've got my small cast iron skillet <time_token_48> <time_token_49> on medium high heat here. And I'm going to put in about a quarter of an inch or so of <time_token_49> <time_token_51> extra virgin olive oil into the bottom of that. And I'm going to let that come up to temperature. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> And then I'm going to start frying up my chicken pieces. Now you don't want to crowd your pan too <time_token_52> <time_token_53> much here. You want to give them a little room to breathe. And you want to fry these for about <time_token_53> <time_token_55> two minutes on each side. Now frying these will not cook the chicken completely. We're going to <time_token_55> <time_token_56> be baking these and that will finish cooking them. So don't worry about cooking the chicken <time_token_56> <time_token_57> all the way through. You just want to get the breading nice and golden brown. And after about <time_token_57> <time_token_58> two minutes, they should be golden brown on the first side. Go ahead and flip them over <time_token_58> <time_token_60> and continue cooking for another two minutes or so on the second side. And once they're golden <time_token_60> <time_token_61> brown on the second side, you want to remove them off to a plate lined with paper towels. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> And then you want to repeat this process with the other pieces of chicken. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Now that all my chicken has been pan fried, I'm going to put this into a glass baking dish. I'm <time_token_63> <time_token_65> using a 7 by 11, I think, baking dish. You can use a 9 by 13. You just want to put your chicken pieces <time_token_65> <time_token_67> in there. Make sure that they're not overlapping at all. And then you want to ladle on some <time_token_67> <time_token_68> marinara sauce onto each one of your chicken parmesans. Now this is my homemade marinara sauce. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> It is my spaghetti sauce minus the meat. And I have a video that shows how I make that. I will, <time_token_69> <time_token_71> again, put the link in the description box so you can see how I make that. You could also use <time_token_71> <time_token_72> jarred spaghetti sauce. That is perfectly fine. You just want to put maybe about a quarter of a <time_token_72> <time_token_74> cup, half a cup or so of marinara sauce on each chicken parmesan. Next, I'm going to take some <time_token_74> <time_token_76> shredded mozzarella cheese and put a handful or so on top of each chicken parmesan. And you can <time_token_76> <time_token_77> leave it with just the mozzarella on it and it would still be perfectly delicious. However, <time_token_77> <time_token_79> I'm going to take it up a notch and I'm going to add just a little bit of parmesan cheese on top <time_token_79> <time_token_80> of the mozzarella. And then you want to bake these in a preheated 350 degree oven for between 20 and <time_token_80> <time_token_82> 30 minutes or so. You want to make sure that the chicken is cooked completely and done all the way <time_token_82> <time_token_83> through and the cheese is nice and golden brown on top. And when they are done, this is what they <time_token_83> <time_token_85> will look like. Now you can serve these exactly as they are. However, I like to serve mine over <time_token_85> <time_token_86> pasta. So while these were in the oven, I made up a pot of spaghetti. You could also use these and <time_token_86> <time_token_87> make chicken parmesan sandwiches, which would be absolutely amazing. But since I did decide to serve <time_token_87> <time_token_88> this on spaghetti, I went ahead and put some spaghetti onto a plate there, pick out one of <time_token_88> <time_token_90> the chicken parmesans and put it right on top. You could add more sauce to this if you would like. <time_token_90> <time_token_92> And there you go. How to make chicken parmesan at home from scratch.

Today I want to use a recipe which is much older than me <time_token_8> <time_token_10> you know probably this hundred-year-old recipe of crispy fried chicken so let's <time_token_10> <time_token_11> go ahead and learn how to make this chicken <time_token_11> <time_token_13> here is the chicken which I cut into pieces but this chicken has to be put in <time_token_13> <time_token_16> salt brine that means just mix some salt in the water, put this chicken <time_token_16> <time_token_17> inside and put in the refrigerator overnight that's when the chicken will <time_token_17> <time_token_18> become nice and tender <time_token_18> <time_token_21> after that we're going to make a batter to make this. Now I'm going to show you <time_token_21> <time_token_24> a very simple batter using some pepper powder, salt, 1 cup of all-purpose flour <time_token_24> <time_token_27> you know measure it and do it for this recipe and then mix this nicely with <time_token_27> <time_token_31> pepper powder. Now in this we're going to add just beaten 2 eggs, pour it in <time_token_31> <time_token_32> this and half cup of soda <time_token_32> <time_token_36> ok if you want you can also use beer but if you don't want to use beer add half a <time_token_36> <time_token_39> cup of soda and mix this batter slowly this will foam a lot but that's ok <time_token_39> <time_token_41> this will become kind of a thick batter fantastic just make sure that there are <time_token_41> <time_token_43> no lumps wow look at this batter <time_token_43> <time_token_45> perfect isn't it now they're going to dip in chicken here take these chicken <time_token_45> <time_token_47> pieces you know with the help of paper towel or cloth just pat them dry you <time_token_47> <time_token_49> don't want any moisture on this then dip it in this batter <time_token_49> <time_token_51> look at this this is going to be really thick batter look at this chicken <time_token_51> <time_token_54> this is nicely coated with all this batter but you got to keep this in the <time_token_54> <time_token_56> refrigerator for at least one hour before frying so let me put in the <time_token_56> <time_token_58> refrigerator and fry it after one hour after putting in the refrigerator for one <time_token_58> <time_token_59> hour just drop in these pieces of chicken <time_token_59> <time_token_62> wow you know they get nicely marinated also I suppose and then we're going to <time_token_62> <time_token_65> fry this wow more the batter the better but this is a special batter I'm telling <time_token_65> <time_token_68> you this if you make it and try it you will tell me that this is the best fried <time_token_68> <time_token_71> chicken you have ever eaten you know look at this chicken fuming hot but the <time_token_71> <time_token_73> more time you chill the chicken that is battered in the fridge the crispier the <time_token_73> <time_token_76> chicken gets so perfectly fried and inside is juicy while outside is nice <time_token_76> <time_token_81> huh this is fantastic fried chicken almost hundred-year-old recipe they use <time_token_81> <time_token_84> beer but I've used soda but if you get beer, pour beer and make it it will be <time_token_84> <time_token_85> even more delicious super awesome <time_token_85> <time_token_92> hmm oh my god this is super but do not forget vahrehvah is all about inspiring <time_token_92> <time_token_94> others to cook so please post your recipes and cooking tips at vahrehvah.com <time_token_94> <time_token_95> so others can benefit from your great cooking ",

welcome to another episode of Cooking with John. <time_token_0> <time_token_0> I'm John and this is my cooking show. <time_token_0> <time_token_1> This week we're going to be making something that is actually really simple to eat. <time_token_1> <time_token_1> It's very delicious. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> You can do it either in the oven, in the grill, and you can pretty much make this any way <time_token_2> <time_token_3> Today we're going to be making chicken teriyaki shish kebabs. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> I've got four chicken breasts, red pepper, green pepper, jalapeno because Nicki likes <time_token_4> <time_token_4> it spicy, as well as a red onion. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> I'm also going to be using wooden skewers, which are about a foot long. <time_token_5> <time_token_5> You can do this one of two ways. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> You can either mix all your ingredients together, teriyaki sauce, put them on the skewer, throw <time_token_6> <time_token_7> them right on the grill. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> But today I'm actually going to be letting them marinate for about an hour in the teriyaki <time_token_7> <time_token_8> And that way all that flavor will just kind of get saturated right into the meat, right <time_token_8> <time_token_8> into the vegetables. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> I'm also going to be soaking my skewers in cold water for about half an hour. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> So when I put the kebab on the grill, the wood won't burn right away. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> It will be really moist. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> It'll be really wet and it'll absorb a lot of heat and dry out before it starts to just <time_token_11> <time_token_11> burn right away. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> Alright, so the first thing that we're going to do is take our red onion and just cut it <time_token_12> <time_token_13> I've already cleaned out the inside of the peppers. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> You want to get all the seeds out, the stem, and all sorts of stuff in there. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> And again, we're just going to cut this in half and set it aside. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> Same with the green pepper. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Now we really just kind of want the chuck, so you can cut this in thirds and then again <time_token_16> <time_token_17> So we have nice little pieces of red pepper that we can stick on our shish kebab. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> And the same with the green pepper. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Cut it in thirds and then cut your chunks into three pieces. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> And all this is getting set aside in a pan that I will mix all my vegetables up in with <time_token_19> <time_token_19> the chicken and the teriyaki sauce. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> I actually switched to a bigger pan because I have a lot of vegetables. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> And next we take our red onion and we don't need to do anything else except just pull <time_token_20> <time_token_21> it apart and pull that layer off. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> So we'll pull it apart and we'll just throw it in chunk by chunk and this will be what <time_token_22> <time_token_22> you actually throw on the skewer. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> Now we're going to cut up the jalapeno. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Again we're just going to go ahead, cut that into quarters, and we'll just do a couple <time_token_24> <time_token_25> pieces to put on the skewers, just like that. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Okay and next we're going to slice our chicken into chunks and you can cut the larger part <time_token_26> <time_token_26> of the breast in half. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> I like to cut the tip off because it's kind of a smaller piece. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Once we cut the larger part of the breast in half, we're just going to cut the chicken <time_token_28> <time_token_29> into nice small chunks so it will fit on our skewer with our vegetables. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> You can go ahead and throw those in with the vegetables. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Everything is going to get cooked so it doesn't matter that it's touching the raw chicken. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> And when we're done with this, we're going to go ahead and we're just going to add teriyaki <time_token_31> <time_token_32> sauce to the chicken and the vegetables and we're going to mix it all up and let it sit <time_token_32> <time_token_32> in the fridge for about an hour. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> And now comes the fun part where we get to add our teriyaki to the vegetables and the <time_token_34> <time_token_34> Sometimes it comes out pretty slow but I'm going to go ahead and use a whole bottle. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> This is a lot of chicken and a lot of vegetables. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> And now we just take all this and we mix it up by hand and we just kind of massage the <time_token_36> <time_token_37> teriyaki sauce into the vegetables and into the chicken. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> Make sure you get every single piece in there. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> Work it real good and just get a good coating on the vegetables and on the chicken. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> I like this particular chicken teriyaki sauce. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> I'm not exactly sure what brand it is but it's pretty sticky, it's not very runny and <time_token_40> <time_token_40> it sticks to all the chicken and all the vegetables really well. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> And you want to make sure that you really get in, you know, side the pieces of pepper <time_token_42> <time_token_42> You have a corner. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> You want to make sure you get all that teriyaki sauce in and around the whole pepper. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> And I've spent about 5 minutes just really slowly but surely mixing up all the vegetables, <time_token_44> <time_token_44> all the chicken, all the teriyaki sauce. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> I want to make sure that this stuff is just full of flavor. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> And as you can tell, Iris is really, really excited about this video. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> And all I'm going to use is a shallow baking sheet. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> It's about half an inch thick. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> It's about a quarter inch full of water and the sticks will absorb a little bit of water <time_token_48> <time_token_48> but not much. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> You just need to make sure you have a pan that's long enough to hold the skewers. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> So our skewers have been soaking for about 45 minutes. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> The meat, the vegetables and the teriyaki sauce have been also marinating for about <time_token_51> <time_token_51> We're going to go ahead, put them all on the skewers and then take them out to the barbecue <time_token_51> <time_token_52> grill and start grilling. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> I'm just going to show you one or two of these. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> You do the same thing for every one. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> So basically, you start any way you want. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> I like to go onion, green pepper, red pepper, chicken and we'll try to find a nice little <time_token_55> <time_token_55> piece of jalapeno. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> And I like to put the jalapeno next to the chicken so the chicken will actually absorb <time_token_56> <time_token_56> a little bit of that spicy heat. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> And then we just repeat the process. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> We go onion, green pepper, red pepper, chicken, jalapeno and the jalapeno is a little bit <time_token_59> <time_token_59> smaller of a piece of pepper. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> So you basically, you just want to turn the skewer slowly on the jalapeno until you get <time_token_60> <time_token_60> it all the way through and that'll poke a nice little hole through there. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> Onion, green pepper, red pepper, chicken, jalapeno. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> Then we'll go ahead and top it off with an onion. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> One thing you also want to be careful about is that you don't poke yourself with the skewer. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> These are very, very sharp and if you run it into your hand, you're probably going <time_token_64> <time_token_65> to end up poking yourself so bad that you bleed. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> I have a pan here. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> I'm just going to take them and I'm actually just going to set them across the pan like <time_token_66> <time_token_67> All right, so we got nine shish kebabs out of that. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> We're going to go ahead. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> We're going to throw them on the grill for, oh, I don't know, 10 to 20 minutes until the <time_token_68> <time_token_69> chicken is nice and cooked and the vegetables are soft and delicious. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> All right, the grill is hot. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> The kebabs are skewered and I've got an ice cold beer. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> If you're 21 years of age or older than the United States, there's nothing better than <time_token_71> <time_token_71> drinking an ice cold one while you do a little grilling. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> So we're just going to take our kebabs, we're going to put them on our red-hot grill side <time_token_72> <time_token_73> by side all the way across and a lot of times when I'm grilling, I'll leave the dogs inside <time_token_73> <time_token_74> because I don't want them to accidentally get burned. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> I really would not appreciate that. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> We have our teriyaki chicken shish kebabs on the grill. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> We'll do them on about five minutes aside. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> We'll flip them five minutes, flip them five minutes, flip them five minutes and they'll <time_token_77> <time_token_77> be on for about 20 minutes. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> I'm going to cover them for the first 10 minutes to keep all that heat inside and let me tell <time_token_78> <time_token_78> you what, these are going to be absolutely delicious. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> Later, they've been on for 15 minutes. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> I think they're done. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> We're going to go ahead and take them off. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> You can see we're getting a lot of just nice char there. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> All the chicken looks nice and done. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> I'm going to take them off, put them in my pan and then we're going to enjoy. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> And there is the final product. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> And I like to pull all the ingredients off of the skewer. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> You can leave it on if you want, but let's go ahead and give it a try and see how it <time_token_88> <time_token_88> That chicken is delicious. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> It has such a great combination of flavors and let me tell you what. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> You guys are really going to enjoy these. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Well, thanks for tuning into this episode of Cooking with John. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> I really appreciate you guys supporting

<time_token_6> <time_token_8> It's Niko's Kitchen where satisfying meals are prepared. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> We're making the famous Whopper. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> Now the first thing that we're going to have to do, and you've seen me do this before when we've done a few burgers, <time_token_12> <time_token_13> is just grab some baking paper on a flat surface. <time_token_13> <time_token_16> Now the burger patties on a Whopper are a little thicker than we've done before so grab a little bit more ground beef. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> Now this ground beef again is an 80-20 split so it's 20% fat, 80% beef. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> So it's going to be nice and juicy. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> Just mould it into a ball and just put your baking paper back over the top. <time_token_20> <time_token_23> And just grab a rolling pin and what we're going to do is just roll that patty into a nice shape, round shape. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> So try and get the best shape that you can guys and just roll it up just like that. <time_token_24> <time_token_27> And what I want you to do just with those rough edges just using your fingers just go around and tuck them in a bit. <time_token_27> <time_token_29> And just keep repeating that process guys until you've got as many burger patties that you want to make. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> So guys to do the Whopper what you're going to need is a grill. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> Now you can do this on a barbecue or if you've got one of those grill pans you can do it inside. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> But I'm doing it outside because of the flame grill. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> I'm just going to lightly oil the grill just with some vegetable oil. <time_token_35> <time_token_37> And I've got our beef patties here and I'm just going to lay them straight on. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> And guys you want to cook these for about 3 minutes each side. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> They won't take too long but you do want those nice char marks on each side. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> So only about 3 minutes on each side. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> But definitely make sure they're cooked all the way through. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> So you can see there guys those char marks on the burger patties. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> That's what you're looking for when you're grilling them. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> Alrighty guys so our Whopper patties are ready to rock and roll so let's assemble this bad boy up. <time_token_49> <time_token_52> So guys what we've got here is a sesame seed bun that I've just cut in half and I have toasted under the griller. <time_token_52> <time_token_54> Now just focusing on the heel for the second I've got our beef patty and I'm just going to place it onto the heel. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> And on top of that I'm going to put on some pickles. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Then I'm going to be adding some tomato ketchup. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> On top of the ketchup we're going to be putting on some onion now. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> What I did to the onion I just cut a slice and I've taken out the rings just like that. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> And just place them on the top. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> If we just swap around and we're going to start concentrating on the crown. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> I've got some mayonnaise here and I'm just going to grab some of the mayonnaise. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Put it on the crown and just swirl it around to the edges. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> And next I've got some lettuce that I've just shredded. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> I'm going to place that on top of the mayo. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> And finally we're going to place on some tomatoes and you want them about that thick. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> And then what I want you to do guys grab the crown which is the top part. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> And then just put it on top of the heel. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> And there you have it guys the whopper. <time_token_76> <time_token_79> So guys it's as easy as that to do it at home because you just know it's going to be tasting better. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> I guarantee it. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Speaking of tasting why don't we get stuck into this bad boy. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Just check that out it does look super super awesome. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> And that's how authentic it is. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> I even dripped some. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> As always the ingredients are below so check it out and give this a go because I'm telling you. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Homemade is the way to go trust me. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> You guys take care and I will see you this Monday for budget meals. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> So until then take care.

<time_token_4> <time_token_5> You know, in India, what we do is go out to dine, especially on the highways. <time_token_5> <time_token_5> Now, on the highways, you'll find excellent dhabas. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> Now, these are kind of rustic restaurants, roadside eateries, but they're very, very <time_token_6> <time_token_7> You know, some of them are legends, actually. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> Everybody remembers going there and dining. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> And I remember a few of them. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> One of them is near Bombay, you know, in Lonavla. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> Sometimes when I go to Punjab, I see this very famous dhaba on the Ambala road towards <time_token_9> <time_token_9> And I'm sure it'll remind you of the chicken curry that you've eaten there. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> And that's what I'm trying to do. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> Now, the highway chicken curry, that's what I'm cooking, okay? <time_token_10> <time_token_11> For highway chicken curry, what you require is quickly some onions which I am going to <time_token_11> <time_token_12> Now, if you're cooking around 800 grams of chicken on the bone, essentially on the bone <time_token_12> <time_token_12> only, okay, otherwise no fun. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> Take at least four onions, and I'll slice them. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> In the meanwhile, what you need to do here, a vessel, cooking vessel on the flame, oil <time_token_14> <time_token_14> here required is little more than usual. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Now, highway chicken curries are generally high fragrant dishes, little spicier. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> That's what they're famous for. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> That's why we like them. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> And garam masala, the blend and the whole garam masala is little high. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> So what I'm doing is cinnamon here, black cardamom, four to five of them. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> When you put black cardamom, important, open them up, okay? <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Otherwise what's going to happen, if they burst, there's a chance of you, you know, <time_token_18> <time_token_18> So very important. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> Four to five of them, small cardamom, six, eight of them, nice fragrance, okay? <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Human, one teaspoon, some cloves in here. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> And before these things burn, I need to slice the onions. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> Wow, managed to cook fast. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> And human is nice and brown. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> The moment you smell the fragrance of the spices, you add the sliced onion. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> Four of them is what I have sliced for approximately 800 grams of chicken on bone. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> That's very, very important, saute the onions, very elastic curry. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> The quantity of tomatoes added is also quite high in this. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> And one more thing I must tell you, the quantity of ginger and green chilli is also high. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> When you eat them, you must get that slurry thing in your\u2026 you must hear that. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> This is what you need to hear that. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> That's what we all like when we go out dining, especially the chicken curry, yeah? <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Take tomatoes, three large tomatoes, and I'm going to cut them, chop them actually. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> I've got chicken already in here. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> Now, I must tell you, the highway guys, you know, some of them use desi ghee or saturated <time_token_30> <time_token_30> Now, I've got some here. <time_token_30> <time_token_30> You want to add it, you can add it. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> What's going to happen is it's going to increase the taste. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> So if it's a matter of taste, let me add one tablespoon of this, just one tablespoon, <time_token_32> <time_token_33> so that it brings out the great flavor, oil also, and wow, suddenly the profile changes. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> You know, the smell of this changes, absolutely divine. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> Now, let this get brown, tomatoes to be chopped, a watchful eye in here, stir this up. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> As the onion start browning up, what you need to do next is be prepared with the ginger <time_token_36> <time_token_36> and garlic paste, very important. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> So here, the quantity of ginger is more than the garlic, that's what I do. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> Hence, the pastes are separate, but you have a choice. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> You can use definitely ginger and garlic paste together, and later, you can add the ginger <time_token_39> <time_token_39> julians that I'm going to add here. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Ginger paste, one and a half tablespoon, garlic paste, one tablespoon, saute for about a minute. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Treat every ingredient with respect, yeah, the way you would do to your family members, <time_token_41> <time_token_41> this is the family member of the chicken curry, the highway chicken curry. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> So let this saute, the smell should go off, and then the tomatoes that go in. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Some people do add the tomatoes later after the chicken, because they think the quantity, <time_token_43> <time_token_44> I mean, the time taken to cook the chicken is increased. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> Yes, because of the acidity, it does happen. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> But I want the tomatoes to get pulpy and mushy, you know, so that the gravy becomes smooth. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> If you add the chicken first, and then the tomatoes, the tomatoes will not get pulpy, <time_token_46> <time_token_46> and you might not get a smooth gravy. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> So after you add tomatoes, you need to cook for at least four, five minutes, so that the <time_token_47> <time_token_47> whole mixture gets mushier and smoother, and then the next thing. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> So let this get cooked first for at least four, five minutes. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Now as the tomatoes are getting pulpier, yeah, see, they're getting pulpier, which makes <time_token_49> <time_token_49> the gravy smoother, what I'm going to do is, this will keep cooking, and in the meanwhile, <time_token_49> <time_token_50> I'll slice some ginger, and cut some choulions of this. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> So take about half an inch piece of ginger, and cut choulions of the same. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Some green chilies, three of them, now this is the spicier one, so you need to be careful. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Three of them, if you don't like it spicy, you can avoid it, but what you need to do <time_token_53> <time_token_54> is, slit it from the middle, all this goes in to this mixture. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Ginger, choulions, green chilies, absolute rustic, yeah. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Now next, I'm going to add some red chili powder, one and a half teaspoon, if you get <time_token_56> <time_token_56> the colored variety, the Kashmiri variety, very good. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> One and a half tablespoon of coriander powder, half teaspoon of cumin powder, and one-fourth <time_token_57> <time_token_58> teaspoon of the turmeric, garam masala, one teaspoon of this, okay, and this you need <time_token_58> <time_token_59> to add while you're cooking, okay, that's important. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> And then, you need to add salt, sing along, jump, dance, do whatever you want to do, do <time_token_60> <time_token_60> namak shamak, this is what you can do, okay, there you go, suddenly the chicken curry starts <time_token_60> <time_token_61> looking good now, the masala especially, cook this further for three, four minutes after <time_token_61> <time_token_61> you add the dry spices. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Now if this chicken was not farm fed, like what probably I remember during my childhood <time_token_62> <time_token_63> days, it would never be farm fed chicken, like what we call broiler chicken, this would <time_token_63> <time_token_64> have been cooked before the tomatoes were added, because the local chicken, the Desi <time_token_64> <time_token_64> chicken as we Indians call, doesn't get cooked easily, okay, so as you cook the ginger garlic <time_token_64> <time_token_65> and the onions, then you need to add the chicken, it's little tough, but the taste I tell you <time_token_65> <time_token_66> This one you can take a risk of adding later, when all the spices have been added, everything <time_token_66> <time_token_67> has been added, then you add the chicken is absolutely fine, because this doesn't take <time_token_67> <time_token_67> too much time to cook, so what I'm going to do is after three, four minutes of cooking <time_token_67> <time_token_68> the entire thing with the dry spices and the salt, everything together, see the color is <time_token_68> <time_token_69> absolutely beautiful, the chicken goes in, keep cooking without the water in this, let <time_token_69> <time_token_70> the chicken get cooked with the spices, tomatoes and onion, I'm not going to add any kind of <time_token_70> <time_token_71> water at this point of time, let this get cooked, maybe cover this up, yes, cover this <time_token_71> <time_token_72> up and let it get cooked, we'll keep stirring in between, in the meanwhile, one very important <time_token_72> <time_token_73> thing, loads of coriander is also added to this dish, so about two, three tablespoon <time_token_73> <time_token_73> chopped coriander, if you want to measure the quantity in tablespoons, probably three <time_token_73> <time_token_74> tablespoons of chopped coriander, gives a nice flavor to the dish, this is something <time_token_74> <time_token_76> which is very, very fragrant, coriander in India, used probably almost in everything, <time_token_76> <time_token_77> some dishes we added before, while we are cooking actually, in some we would add as <time_token_77> <time_token_77> a garnish on top, nowadays, yes, all chefs prefer, you know, adding a sprig of it, but <time_token_77> <time_token_78> in a dish like this, which is rustic, I would certainly add this point of time only, gives <time_token_78> <time_token_79> a nice flavor, coriander in here, and at this point of time, first give a stir, after cooking <time_token_79> <time_token_81> about five minutes in the dry spices, I'll add some water, so in goes the water, about <time_token_81> <time_token_82> 500 ml of water is what you will add to the chicken, and now cover this up and cook, the <time_token_82> <time_token_83> highway curries are generally thin, so water, you can keep adjusting, I've added 500 ml <time_token_83> <time_token_83> of water first, the chicken will also ooze out water, and let this get cooked for at <time_token_83> <time_token_84> least six to eight minutes, nicely in the spices, and then little more of garam masala <time_token_84> <time_token_85> in the last before we finish the dish, after about 15 minutes, you know, what you need <time_token_85> <time_token_86> to see is, wow, look at this, now the whole gravy looks delicious, very important to note <time_token_86> <time_token_87> that the chicken should be cooked, now how would you come to know, one important thing <time_token_87> <time_token_88> is to note that, specially take the leg piece, as it keeps shrinking, and the entire flesh <time_token_88> <time_token_88> gets pulled up, then you know the chicken is almost cooked, you start seeing the bone <time_token_88> <time_token_89> down here, this is what you see, and you come to know, that's when the chicken is cooked, <time_token_89> <time_token_90> so now this is ready, if you think it is not ready, when you are cooking, probably the <time_token_90> <time_token_91> chicken would be bigger, so you can cook further, you know, more than 15 minutes, finally some <time_token_91> <time_token_92> more garam masala, increase the fragrance, I added initially also, and now once again, <time_token_92> <time_token_93> chicken is ready, serve, got a beautiful bowl here, very rustic, you see very rustic, absolutely <time_token_93> <time_token_94> divine, the curry is thin, it's never thick, the onions are usually like this, what you <time_token_94> <time_token_95> see here, and it's spicy, I'm just garnishing it with fresh coriander, you can straight <time_token_95> <time_token_95> away take some bread, take some buns, get some steamed rice, if you really want to <time_token_95> <time_token_96> enjoy it, get some steamed rice, and then eat it, remember the highway days, this is <time_token_96> <time_token_96> what it is.

"<time_token_0> <time_token_3> Hello, this is Chef John from Foodwishes.com with Potato Pancakes, one of my favorite potato <time_token_4> <time_token_5> It's something I just don't make often enough. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> It's super easy to make, take two pounds, actually I had two and a quarter, two pounds <time_token_7> <time_token_10> of russet potatoes, peel them and then grate them with a cheese grater into a bowl of very <time_token_10> <time_token_12> And I'm also going to grate in half an onion into the same bowl, and by the way, you've <time_token_12> <time_token_13> never cried until you've grated onion. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> It's a good cry. <time_token_14> <time_token_16> Alright, once that's done, I'm going to add some more water, fill it up a little more, <time_token_16> <time_token_18> and these are just going to sit in the cold water for about 20, 30 minutes. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> You don't need to rinse it, just let them sit there. <time_token_19> <time_token_23> In the meantime, take a couple eggs, some flour, black pepper, a little pinch of cayenne, <time_token_23> <time_token_26> salt of course, and we're going to whisk that up until very smooth and then set that aside. <time_token_27> <time_token_29> When our potatoes are ready, drain them, rinse them, put them in a colander and squeeze, <time_token_29> <time_token_30> squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> All the water must be squeezed out. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> So I squeeze it a fistful at a time and then I press it again with some paper towel and <time_token_34> <time_token_35> make sure all the water is out of your potatoes. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> It's the only way to screw this up, is to have wet potatoes. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> Once the potatoes are as dry as humanly possible, add them to a bowl, mix in your egg mixture <time_token_39> <time_token_41> with a spatula, and that is a potato pancake mixture ready to fry. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> It's an incredibly easy recipe, I told you. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> I'm going to cover that while I make these because you don't want any air to get to the <time_token_44> <time_token_46> potatoes if possible, because they do oxidize. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> It's not something you could store, put away, and it's going to be good the next day. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> So you're going to want to make this stuff fresh. <time_token_48> <time_token_51> All right, now to fry these, we're going to use a heavy duty skillet with a good amount <time_token_51> <time_token_52> of oil, they say a quarter inch of oil, I don't know if you quite need that much on <time_token_52> <time_token_54> the bottom, but you need enough oil to come up to the side, at least half way up the <time_token_54> <time_token_55> pancake if you want a nice crispy cake. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> This one I'm just doing a little test to taste for salt. <time_token_56> <time_token_59> We're going to heat the pan on medium high, and when it's hot, add your pancake mixture, <time_token_59> <time_token_59> flatten it out. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> This one's a little smaller than the ones you're going to see, but again I'm just tasting <time_token_61> <time_token_63> I'm going to taste this, oh man, so good, and it did need a little more seasoning. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> So what you want to do is you want to put your oil in the pan, heat it to medium high. <time_token_65> <time_token_68> When it starts to shimmer, add your potatoes, flatten them down a little bit, they don't <time_token_68> <time_token_68> have to be round, who says they have to be round? <time_token_68> <time_token_71> If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times, the kitchen is no place for perfectionist. <time_token_71> <time_token_73> All right, flatten them down to about a half inch, cook them for about, like I said, five <time_token_73> <time_token_73> minutes per side. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> You want to see the edges get really crispy and crunchy before you turn them, five minutes <time_token_75> <time_token_76> on the other side. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> And when I flip them, normally I'll turn it down to medium. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Because this is raw potato, you got to give it time to cook through. <time_token_79> <time_token_81> If you keep going on high heat or medium high the whole way, sometimes towards the <time_token_81> <time_token_83> end the edges start getting a little too brown and the middle isn't quite tender enough. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> And there you go. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> I top mine with smoked salmon, sour cream and dill, very classic combination. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> You could do these with apple sauce and sour cream, another even more classic combination, <time_token_88>

be cooking from my kitchen today and we're going to be making <time_token_2> <time_token_2> some fun and delicious food. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> So, let's go ahead and get started. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> Now for the filling, I'm going to use pre-cooked frozen jumbo shrimp and I am just going to <time_token_6> <time_token_7> soak it in cold water until they are defrosted. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> And once the shrimp have defrosted, we can go ahead and just strain them in a colander. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> And once the shrimp are drained from the colander, I'm just going to go ahead and take the tails <time_token_11> <time_token_12> off and then just chop them into rough pieces, about a quarter of an inch thick, like this. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> And once the pieces are chopped, we can go ahead and set them aside. <time_token_13> <time_token_15> The first thing that we want to do is go ahead and peel all of the skin off using a peeler <time_token_15> <time_token_16> And once all of the skin is removed from your ginger, you want to go ahead and grate it <time_token_17> <time_token_17> using a grater just like this. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> And once your ginger is all grated, you can go ahead and set it aside. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> And what I want to do is first just cut about an inch off of the top of the greens, like <time_token_20> <time_token_21> And then I just want to cut off the root bases, like that. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Now what I want to do is I'm just going to cut them into about a quarter inch pieces, <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Once the onions are cut, then we can set them aside while we prepare our other ingredients. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Now the other part of my filling is just going to be a broccoli slaw mix. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> Now this is broccoli, carrots, and red cabbage, and it's already pre-chopped and it makes <time_token_28> <time_token_28> it so much easier to make the filling for our spring rolls. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Now to the broccoli mix, I'm just going to add the peanut oil. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> The grated ginger, the green onions, chopped garlic. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Now this chopped garlic I actually buy in the grocery store pre-chopped. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> It actually just saves a lot of time in preparing your foods. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> But you can use fresh garlic if you wish, just two teaspoons of that. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> About a teaspoon of ground coriander. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> Now I'm using this Moroccan coriander that I got. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> I think I got this at World Market, but I just want to put about a teaspoon of that. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> And then a teaspoon of five spice powder. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Now five spice powder you can usually find at most Oriental grocery stores, and sometimes <time_token_42> <time_token_43> you might be able to find it in the ethnic section of your local grocery store. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> So we just want a teaspoon of this as well. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Then we want to add just a little bit of grated lime rind. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> This is just the zest of the lime. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> So again, I'm just going to hold this grater over my bowl and just zest just a little bit <time_token_47> <time_token_48> of this grated lime into my broccoli slaw. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> And the last thing that we want to add is some salt. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Now I'm using this pink Himalayan salt that I've actually had gotten, and I just want <time_token_50> <time_token_51> to add about a half a teaspoon of that salt. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> And now I'm just going to stir until everything is mixed up together. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> And once the broccoli has microwaved for about one to two minutes and has become soft <time_token_54> <time_token_55> just a little bit, you just want to stir it around again just to mix up the ingredients. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> And then we want to go ahead and add in the shrimp. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> And then just stir until the shrimp is combined into the mixture as well. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> Now to wrap our spring rolls, I'm just going to add about three teaspoons of cornstarch <time_token_61> <time_token_61> mixed with a little bit of water. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> And this is just going to make a paste so that we can seal our spring rolls thoroughly. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> I'm just going to use these spring roll wrappers. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> You can usually find them in the frozen section of most Oriental grocery stores. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Go ahead and place the wrappers on a plate. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> And you just want to take a little bit of the mixture and kind of put it in the center, <time_token_68> <time_token_69> but more towards you like this. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> And you want to make sure to get some of the shrimp in with the broccoli. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> And then what we want to do is we just want to fold this over and then bring the sides <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Now sometimes if you get a little bit too much of the mixture, it'll start to poke out. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Just kind of push it back in. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> And you want to go ahead and fold the sides in and make sure they're in there tightly <time_token_74> <time_token_75> because if there's any holes, you will get spits and spatters when you go to fry them. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> And then you just want to slowly roll up like this. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> And then at the end you want to take some of that cornstarch mixture on your finger <time_token_77> <time_token_78> and just rub it lightly and then close it to seal. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> And there's your finished roll and you can go ahead and place this on a baking sheet. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> And what we're going to do after that is we're going to deep fry them. <time_token_82> <time_token_86> It was easy! <time_token_86> <time_token_87> So once all the spring rolls are wrapped, we can go ahead and heat about two cups of <time_token_87> <time_token_88> peanut oil on high. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> And once the oil is hot, about 350 degrees, we can go ahead and add in our rolls. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> And we just want to let them cook until they are brown. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> And once they turn golden brown in color, you can go ahead and remove them and place <time_token_93> <time_token_93> them on a plate lined with paper towels. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> And once they are done cooking, then they are ready to serve.

<time_token_3> <time_token_5> New Year, kong yi factory everybody, and I'm going to show you how to make this very popular <time_token_5> <time_token_7> dish and it's always a popular one at my house, it's my kung pao chicken. <time_token_7> <time_token_10> To start off with, I have two chicken breasts cut into small chunks in a bowl, we're going <time_token_10> <time_token_13> to make a marinade for these by using a tablespoon of some soy sauce, big tablespoon, and if <time_token_13> <time_token_15> you've got some Chinese rice wine or dry sherry, that will do, my mum always use, oh <time_token_15> <time_token_18> today's, about a tablespoon of that as well, my mum always use dry sherry instead of Chinese <time_token_18> <time_token_20> rice wine, if you can find it, and we're going to use about a tablespoon of corn flour or <time_token_20> <time_token_22> corn starch, I'm just going to mix that all together and leave it to one side, there aren't <time_token_22> <time_token_24> that many ingredients actually in this dish, we have garlic, ginger, dried red chillies, roasted <time_token_24> <time_token_27> peanuts, corn flour and some soy sauces for the sauce and some spring onions, I'm cutting my red <time_token_27> <time_token_30> chillies in half and taking the seeds out because there are a lot of them in this, you can see, take <time_token_30> <time_token_32> them out and if I didn't take the seeds out of this dish, it will probably blow my head off. <time_token_32> <time_token_35> Slice your spring onions up to quite, actually not too small, better small, it's actually really <time_token_35> <time_token_37> important to get all your ingredients ready first before you start cooking, so all my kind of spring <time_token_37> <time_token_39> onions and garlic ginger is chopped, my chicken is marinating, all I've got to do now is put together <time_token_39> <time_token_41> all the kind of sauce ingredients into one bowl so that it's ready to throw in at the right time. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> Sauce ingredients are a couple more tablespoons of soy sauce, there we are, I will put all the <time_token_44> <time_token_47> quantities up on my blog for you, you want a teaspoon of some Chinese rice vinegar which is <time_token_47> <time_token_50> like black, the black one, if you don't have it just use balsamic as a substitute, a teaspoon of <time_token_50> <time_token_53> sugar, a couple of tablespoons of water, this helps make it more saucy, a teaspoon of corn flour, <time_token_53> <time_token_55> so mix together, that's all that goes in the sauce, okay, we are now ready to cook, <time_token_55> <time_token_58> I've got my wok on, that's heating up, I'm gonna pop in two tablespoons each of some plain oil, <time_token_58> <time_token_60> like round nut and I like to add a dash of sesame seed oil to this as well, it's not essential but <time_token_60> <time_token_63> if you've got it handy, wok a little bit, chilies going in, now putting the chilies in first actually <time_token_63> <time_token_67> helps just flavor the oil a bit, now my chicken's going in, the heat's not too high because obviously <time_token_67> <time_token_69> we don't want everything to burn while the chicken is cooking, once the chicken's browned all over <time_token_69> <time_token_72> will turn white like this, then we can add garlic, ginger, <time_token_74> <time_token_77> most of the spring onions, save some of them, keep some of them back for sprinkling on later <time_token_77> <time_token_77> and your sauce <time_token_80> <time_token_81> and just keep stirring until everything is nicely coated and cooked through <time_token_82> <time_token_84> you see how the corn flour makes a really nice sticky sauce there, <time_token_84> <time_token_85> serve the chicken up on a bed of steamed white rice, <time_token_85> <time_token_89> it's delicious, and I'm gonna add a few more sprinkles of these spring onions on top <time_token_89> <time_token_91> so I hope you all really enjoy making this dish for yourself, leave me your comments, <time_token_91> <time_token_93> I

show you guys how to make one of my favorite toasties now <time_token_8> <time_token_10> it's loosely based on the classic French croissant sure I think life's a little <time_token_10> <time_token_12> bit too short to be making bechamel or a toastie so I'm going to speed that up <time_token_12> <time_token_14> a little bit we've got a bit of creme fraiche some Dijon mustard and some <time_token_14> <time_token_15> lovely cheese and we're going to use that instead of the bechamel so the first <time_token_15> <time_token_17> thing we're going to do is combine these three in a bowl a little bit of creme <time_token_19> <time_token_21> Dijon mustard we've got some lovely Gruyere that we've already grated so <time_token_21> <time_token_24> good handful of that in there I'm just going to mix that to combine so this is <time_token_24> <time_token_26> our bechamel replacement that's all combined now we don't really need to <time_token_26> <time_token_28> season that because the cheese has got enough tang to it it's a lovely sour <time_token_28> <time_token_29> dough and we're just going to spread this mixture on the sourdough put some of <time_token_29> <time_token_31> this beautiful primo double smoked leg ham on there and we're going to toast <time_token_31> <time_token_34> that off spread this mixture on to the bread be nice and generous because you <time_token_34> <time_token_37> want loads of cheese in this we're doing two layers one for the bottom which will <time_token_37> <time_token_39> put the ham on and then one on the top which is going to bubble at once you put <time_token_39> <time_token_41> in the oven it'll crisp up would be gorgeous so nice and generous now this <time_token_41> <time_token_43> is the primo ham and I really love this stuff so he's gonna be super generous <time_token_43> <time_token_45> with that layer it on okay so we've got the ham on there just lay this other <time_token_45> <time_token_47> piece straight on the top like that we want this all melting and golden I'm <time_token_47> <time_token_49> just going to give a tiny bit of salt now a bit of butter into a medium pan <time_token_51> <time_token_54> soon as that starts to bubble up we're gonna pop our sandwich straight in now <time_token_54> <time_token_55> the idea is we're going to start the cooking process here it's going to get <time_token_55> <time_token_57> nice and brown on the bottom that butter is going to give it a lovely flavor once <time_token_57> <time_token_58> it's brown we're going to pop that into an oven for about eight minutes and <time_token_58> <time_token_60> that's going to get warmed through crispy and crunchy on the top and then <time_token_60> <time_token_62> I have one of my favorite toasty probably takes a couple of minutes for <time_token_62> <time_token_64> that now this toasty is beautiful and golden on the bottom I've got it in an <time_token_64> <time_token_66> ovenproof griddle pan so transfer that to the oven it's on medium and we're <time_token_66> <time_token_67> going to pop that in there for about eight minutes bring it out it's going to <time_token_67> <time_token_70> be all beautiful and golden and we're going to be ready to rock and roll okay <time_token_70> <time_token_73> it's been about eight minutes now I'm going to pull this out of the oven yeah <time_token_73> <time_token_75> that is gooey and bubbly and gorgeous so a good tip and I've learned this the <time_token_75> <time_token_77> hard ways if you put a tea towel over the handle of that when you go to grab <time_token_77> <time_token_79> it again you won't burn your hand off so keep that in mind now this toasty is <time_token_79> <time_token_81> looking pretty damn good and bring that over and you see that cheese is all <time_token_81> <time_token_85> melting the ham's nicely warmed through we're just going to cut that pop that on <time_token_85> <time_token_89> the plate and that is all you need to do there you go

<time_token_3> Hi everyone, it's Anya from Cooking with Plants and today I'm making a no oil added hummus. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> This is great for a snack whenever you're hungry, great for breakfast, lunch or dinner, <time_token_4> <time_token_5> and great for your kids and for lunches. So let's get started. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> The main ingredients that I use as a base for my hummus is a tin of chickpeas <time_token_7> <time_token_8> and a tin of cannellini beans or butter beans or any other white bean that you may have on hand. <time_token_8> <time_token_10> I do sometimes cook the beans from scratch as well but just for a quick easy hummus recipe <time_token_10> <time_token_11> I like to use the tinned and I also use some of the liquid from the tin. <time_token_11> <time_token_13> So these are organic and they are in water and some salt so I won't be adding too much extra salt. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Sometimes I don't add any extra salt at all just depending on who I'm cooking for on the day <time_token_14> <time_token_16> and what the purpose is for the hummus. So I'll start by just draining these very quickly. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> Just get the juice out of the chickpeas and just roughly drain them. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> There will be some chickpeas left over. I'm using a food processor today. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> It just takes less liquid to actually make them but I do quite often make it in the blender as well. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> You'll just need to add more liquid until you get the right consistency. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> So in goes the tin of chickpeas. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> So next I'm going to do the same thing as I just did with the chickpeas but with the cannellini beans. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Again roughly draining them. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> While I remember I'm also going to take out just a few of these chickpeas for decorating the hummus at the end <time_token_28> <time_token_28> when I put them into a bowl. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> So I'll just leave those there on a little plate for later and I'll add in the cannellini beans. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> So each of these tins has 425g so if you're cooking these from scratch <time_token_34> <time_token_35> maybe about a cup and a half to two cups and then you can just gauge the moisture level <time_token_35> <time_token_36> and add more moisture to the mixture as you need it. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Next I'm adding in two very large cloves of garlic. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> It's up to you how much garlic you want to use. Sometimes we use up to six cloves of garlic <time_token_38> <time_token_38> so my husband likes to be very heavy handed with his garlic. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Today I'm just using two large cloves probably equivalent to about four small or four regular sized cloves. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Next I'm adding the juice of one lemon. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> You can add the juice of two if you like a lemony taste. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Just adjust the taste as you go as to your preference. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> Next I'm adding two tablespoons of tahini which is just ground up sesame paste. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> There's no added oil in this paste at all. <time_token_46> <time_token_49> It's just 100% ground up sesame seeds and this is really good for iron. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> A little bit of extra iron and the lemon juice in this will also help with the absorption of the iron. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> I love your hummus. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Next I'm adding in one teaspoon of ground up cumin seeds <time_token_52> <time_token_53> but you can also use the whole seeds if you like. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> They're nice and add a little bit of a nice texture in there too. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Today I'm adding the ground version. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> As I mentioned earlier we are going to be adding some of the salty liquid from the beans and the chickpeas <time_token_56> <time_token_57> but you can add salt and pepper to taste. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> I am going to add a little bit of Celtic sea salt today and some white pepper. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> I just like the way the white pepper brings out the flavours. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> I've got about one teaspoon of Celtic sea salt and about a quarter of a teaspoon of the white pepper. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> As I mentioned earlier when I'm making hummus, <time_token_62> <time_token_62> depending on if I'm making it in the food processor or in my blender, <time_token_62> <time_token_64> the liquid that's used will vary because you don't need as much liquid when using a food processor. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> Just to start with I'm going to put about a quarter of a cup and a little bit more. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> That's about half a cup there to start with. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> I'll just start that blending process and see what the texture will be like. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> If I need to adjust it I'll do so at that time. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> That's been processing for about half a minute and that is quite a runny consistency. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> I probably could have even used a little bit less liquid. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> I'm just so used to making it in my blender instead of here that it's ended up a bit more runny. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Maybe start with a quarter of a cup of the mixture and give it a taste test. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I've actually got my son home today so I'm going to call him in in a minute to taste this <time_token_79> <time_token_80> and give you some feedback on how good this is. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> I've got my son Josh with me here and he loves his hummus so I'm just serving him out some. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> I'm going to take five. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> I'm getting to do a taste test for you. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> There we go. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Mum mum mum. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> Making me hungry. How's that taste? <time_token_87> <time_token_88> We haven't had homemade hummus in such a long time. <time_token_88> <time_token_90> So we're just having these with some little rice crackers, brown rice crackers with a little bit of tomorrow's seaweed in those. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> That's just a really easy combination. <time_token_91> <time_token_93> It's also great with some carrot sticks or some bell peppers dipped into it, anything you like. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> These are just fantastic. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> If you like today's recipe please give it a thumbs up. <time_token_94> <time_token_96> If you haven't already subscribed to the channel please do get all of my future recipes as well and check out all the other things that I've already made. <time_token_96> <time_token_98> Let me know if there's anything in particular that you'd like me to make for you for next time and I will see you then.

<time_token_3> spaghetti and meatballs super easy and delicious almost every person on planet <time_token_3> <time_token_4> earth enjoys a delicious bowl of spaghetti and meatballs at least once a <time_token_4> <time_token_6> year right right so let's get started so I use a saute pan with high sides to <time_token_6> <time_token_7> make my sauce drizzle a little bit of olive oil and throw in my chopped <time_token_7> <time_token_8> onions I saute the onions on medium-low heat for about three minutes make sure <time_token_8> <time_token_10> not to burn them and then add in your minced garlic after I threw in the <time_token_10> <time_token_11> garlic I seasoned it with a pinch of salt and pepper then I threw in the <time_token_11> <time_token_13> fresh basil do not saute the garlic for more than 15 to 20 seconds garlic burns <time_token_13> <time_token_15> extremely quickly I like to use one can of peeled tomatoes and one can of crushed <time_token_15> <time_token_16> tomatoes you can do both cans of crushed tomatoes but I do like the sauce to be a <time_token_16> <time_token_17> little bit chunky and you won't get a chunky sauce from a can of crushed <time_token_17> <time_token_19> tomatoes pour in about a cup of water to loosen it up a bit I took a potato <time_token_19> <time_token_21> masher or in this case a tomato masher and I mashed up those tomatoes even <time_token_21> <time_token_22> though you mash the tomatoes you're still going to have little chunks of <time_token_22> <time_token_23> tomatoes floating around your sauce and that's what I love ironically I hated <time_token_23> <time_token_24> those chunks of tomatoes in my sauce when I was a kid I also hated fruit <time_token_24> <time_token_26> chunks in my yogurt as a kid things really change when you get older though <time_token_26> <time_token_28> I seasoned it with salt pepper oregano and a little bit of sugar tomatoes can <time_token_28> <time_token_29> be a bit sour and the sugar will help with that some people recommend adding <time_token_29> <time_token_31> half of a grated carrot carrots are sweet but sugar works for me I really <time_token_31> <time_token_32> tried looking for the lid of this pan I couldn't find it so I use aluminum foil <time_token_32> <time_token_33> and then I lowered the heat to medium-low so while the sauce was simmering <time_token_33> <time_token_35> I started making my meatballs I used a blend of beef pork and veal I broke it <time_token_35> <time_token_36> up with my fingers you may use a fork if you don't want to use a blend of beef <time_token_36> <time_token_38> pork and veal you can use beef by itself and they will be delicious as well here <time_token_38> <time_token_40> I have one slice of bread that I placed in my food processor and I added it to <time_token_40> <time_token_41> my beef you can just break it up with your fingers I threw in some parsley <time_token_41> <time_token_43> fresh garlic I didn't use onions since the sauce already has onions I know it <time_token_43> <time_token_44> has garlic too but you never have enough garlic an egg some milk to moisten <time_token_44> <time_token_46> things up a bit a little bit of chili powder I like the kick it gives lots of <time_token_46> <time_token_48> parmesan cheese and make sure to season this well with salt and pepper and now I <time_token_48> <time_token_49> did mention earlier that spaghetti and meatballs was my favorite childhood dish <time_token_49> <time_token_51> I used to make it all the time by myself while I watched Nickelodeon if you're <time_token_51> <time_token_52> wondering how I made it back then two words chef priority manhunt truth or <time_token_52> <time_token_54> dare monopoly pool Marco Polo Doug and Rugrats there was just no time for <time_token_54> <time_token_55> cooking when I was a kid so all my young viewers making all of these recipes you <time_token_55> <time_token_56> guys seriously rock already no flavoring mix the meat until everything is <time_token_56> <time_token_58> incorporated but make sure not to over mix and now if you're a beginner cook <time_token_58> <time_token_59> you might struggle with the salt and pepper to taste when things are raw like <time_token_59> <time_token_60> this so a little tip I could give you is to fry a little piece like I showed <time_token_60> <time_token_62> you or one meatball before you start rolling all of them the worst thing you <time_token_62> <time_token_63> can do is serve your guests under season food so that's optional to do I rolled <time_token_63> <time_token_65> little meatballs like this you may make them as little or as big as you like <time_token_65> <time_token_66> whatever size you prefer just make sure they're all the same size so they all <time_token_66> <time_token_67> cook evenly so they scale it with some vegetable oil I fried the meatballs for <time_token_67> <time_token_69> about three to four minutes on each side over a medium-high heat the inside <time_token_69> <time_token_70> will still be raw but I like to finish cooking them in the sauce they are <time_token_70> <time_token_71> pretty small so I just rock my skillet back and forth and they'll just flip <time_token_71> <time_token_72> over on their own if they're bigger you can always use some tongs to flip them <time_token_72> <time_token_74> over my sauce has been simmering for about 20 minutes or so I like to add <time_token_74> <time_token_76> some extra fresh basil I place the meatballs into the pan and I let them <time_token_76> <time_token_77> simmer in the sauce for an additional 20 minutes or so covered and funny thing <time_token_77> <time_token_79> is I loved spaghetti and meatballs so much as a kid that when I went to <time_token_79> <time_token_80> restaurants with my parents I would always order spaghetti and meatballs and <time_token_80> <time_token_81> they would cringe oh well I couldn't get enough all right so I placed the <time_token_81> <time_token_82> spaghetti into my pan I don't like to serve it diner style diner style they <time_token_82> <time_token_84> just ladle the sauce onto your pasta and they don't completely drain the pasta so <time_token_84> <time_token_85> I like to mix the pasta with the sauce and drain the pasta really well I just <time_token_85> <time_token_87> don't prefer it watery so this is how I served it it was completely drenched in <time_token_87> <time_token_88> the sauce which I love and it was a bit messy but I cleaned it off later I like <time_token_88> <time_token_89> to serve three to four meatballs per person but of course it all depends on <time_token_89> <time_token_91> the actual person my brother prefers six to seven meatballs so then I just <time_token_91> <time_token_92> subtract meatballs from his girlfriend's plate just kidding I graded some fresh <time_token_92> <time_token_94> parmesan on top so this in total should take about 45 minutes to make but it's <time_token_94> <time_token_96> worth it the kids will love it you will love it I placed two basil leaves on top <time_token_96> <time_token_97> to make it look cute I hope

All this is there in this <time_token_11> <time_token_13> recipe but what is unusual about this recipe is that we are going to use Pita Bread. Yes, <time_token_13> <time_token_15> you heard it right, in the recipe of a salad. So let's see how it is made. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> We are going to start by making first the bread cubes. For that I have taken up Pita <time_token_19> <time_token_21> Bread which is available everywhere. What you have to do is lightly brush olive oil <time_token_21> <time_token_25> on both the sides and we will put this on a hot tawa and we will cook it till they are little <time_token_25> <time_token_30> crisp and golden brown in colour. You can also bake it if you wish to. Some people also deep fry <time_token_30> <time_token_33> these pieces. So all you have to do is cut them into cubes and deep fry them. Make sure you press <time_token_33> <time_token_36> it a little so it gets little crispier. So now all you have to do is cut them into cubes. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> So we will keep this aside and we will proceed in making the dressing. The main ingredient in any <time_token_44> <time_token_50> salad is some olive oil, lemon juice, lots of it, lots of some finely chopped garlic. If you are not <time_token_50> <time_token_52> very fond of garlic you can either omit it or reduce it. But trust me the salad without <time_token_52> <time_token_58> garlic won't taste that great. Salt and some pepper powder and we will mix this well. So our <time_token_58> <time_token_60> dressing is ready. Now the final step is tossing our salad. So for that we will take some cucumber <time_token_60> <time_token_65> cubes, some tomato cubes. I have de-seated them and cut them into cubes. We will add some iceberg <time_token_65> <time_token_70> lettuce. Don't chop them, just roughly tear them. Some capsicum cubes, lots of finely chopped parsley, <time_token_70> <time_token_74> lots of finely chopped spring onion greens, chopped mint leaves, some spring onion whites <time_token_74> <time_token_80> which I have sliced them, then our dressing and now finally the bread pieces and we will <time_token_80> <time_token_85> toss this well. Our salad has been tossed well, let's serve it immediately. So our <time_token_85> <time_token_87> Lebanese salad fatouche is now ready. If you like that crunch in your salad make sure you deep-fry <time_token_87> <time_token_91> the pita bread cubes. Serve this immediately and I am sure everybody will relish it.

This is chilled <time_token_2> <time_token_4> Chinese ramen and this stuff is awesome. This really is an awesome summertime dish <time_token_4> <time_token_7> so the first thing we're doing is we're taking a cucumber and we cut it in a little bit less than half and <time_token_7> <time_token_8> then we're gonna cut it in very very thin slices and <time_token_8> <time_token_11> As I mentioned, this is such a refreshing summertime food, especially when it's really hot out <time_token_11> <time_token_14> This is wildly popular in Japan and I used to eat this so much in the summertime. It is just excellent <time_token_15> <time_token_17> Definitely if you haven't had it before now is the time to try to have it because it is it is excellent. So <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Here what we're doing is we're taking those very thin <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Cucumber slices and cutting them into very thin strips as well <time_token_21> <time_token_22> You know, this is eventually gonna be on top of our ramen noodles <time_token_22> <time_token_24> And so we want to try to cut it as cleanly as possible <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Even though the cucumber does get a little bit slippery and it can be difficult <time_token_25> <time_token_28> but that's what we're going for really really thin cucumber slices like so and <time_token_28> <time_token_30> Once we have that that should be good enough. The next step is we're gonna cut up a tomato <time_token_30> <time_token_31> I'm definitely gonna cut the end off first and <time_token_31> <time_token_32> then go ahead slice it in half and <time_token_32> <time_token_35> We're just gonna make wedges here very very well, I just lied we're gonna make thin slices. I take that back <time_token_36> <time_token_38> but the thin slices once again, this is gonna be another a condiment on top of our ramen noodles and <time_token_39> <time_token_42> Really really with the cucumber and the tomato and the other things are gonna put on top just a nice chilled <time_token_42> <time_token_43> lunch or dinner <time_token_43> <time_token_44> So once we have our tomato the next step is we're gonna take <time_token_44> <time_token_47> Deli sliced ham go ahead and cut that in half fold it over and then we're gonna take these <time_token_47> <time_token_50> ham pieces and just cut them into very very thin slices like so and <time_token_50> <time_token_53> once we do that we'll be just about done with our condiments, but uh, it is worth noting this ham doesn't need to be super special there is a <time_token_53> <time_token_56> Very standard Japanese ham slices that we get but really any ham slices will do whatsoever <time_token_56> <time_token_57> so this is what the Chuka ramen looks like and <time_token_58> <time_token_60> Just look for the ramen package that looks like it has a bunch of cold stuff on top of it <time_token_60> <time_token_62> that's what you're looking for now we have boiling water and we're gonna take the ramen noodles and put it on top and <time_token_62> <time_token_64> Really you just kind of mix it around ramen noodles definitely read the package <time_token_64> <time_token_66> But typically especially for the chilled ones. These aren't like the you know, the <time_token_66> <time_token_68> Hard dried ones these only take about two minutes three minutes max now <time_token_68> <time_token_70> We're gonna go ahead and mix them in with very cold water <time_token_70> <time_token_72> Like so and we've lost our big bowl for the day. I think someone borrowed it <time_token_72> <time_token_73> So we're doing it in a salad bowl and a strainer like so <time_token_73> <time_token_76> But you just have really really cold water in there and you just mix it around and just keep mixing and mixing and mixing <time_token_76> <time_token_77> this will give you your chilled noodles like you're looking for and <time_token_77> <time_token_79> Once we have our noodles chilled we take it out shake it around and put it on a plate <time_token_79> <time_token_81> now the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna take our chilled ingredients and <time_token_81> <time_token_83> Put it around on top of the noodles like so you'll see we have the cucumber <time_token_83> <time_token_86> We have the ham slices and we actually went ahead and scrambled an egg as well and cut it into thin slices, too <time_token_86> <time_token_87> And we go ahead and put the tomato <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Not quite wedges on it as well <time_token_88> <time_token_91> And that's what we want to look like then we're gonna take the sauce mix that comes with the ramen noodles and just pour it <time_token_91> <time_token_92> all over on top and <time_token_92> <time_token_93> There you go, and the sauce is delicious, too <time_token_93> <time_token_95> And that's what it looks like.

Ch-ch-ch-chilly dogs! <time_token_4> <time_token_5> And I'm gonna figure out the rest of it later. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> To make our chili, we're gonna start out by opening a beer. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> It's very important that you drink beer while you're making chili, because that is the American way. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> And, oh, that's good. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> I'm gonna put a little oil in here, or a lot, or whatever. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> And I'm gonna saute this onion. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Just try to get it a little bit soft, we don't really need to brown it or anything like that. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> And make sure that you chop it up real, real small. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> The thing about chili dog chili is that it's almost like a meat paste. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> And I know that sounds delicious, and you're probably just like slathering at the mouth right now, <time_token_17> <time_token_18> thinking about meat paste, but I promise that it'll be great once it's done. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> So yeah, just make sure that you mince your onions and everything really, really small. <time_token_19> <time_token_21> Okay, so after just about a minute, your onions will start to look a little bit translucent, not totally, but it's okay. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Now I'm gonna add jalapeno and garlic. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> If you wanted to keep this mild, if you were making this for like a bunch of children or something, <time_token_23> <time_token_24> or very elderly people, then you could just use some green bell pepper for the jalapeno. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> Okay, so now for the funnest part, we're gonna put our meat in. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> I'm gonna put it on top of the onion. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> And now, the second beer that you're gonna need is gonna go in. <time_token_27> <time_token_29> So the thing about the way that they get the meat to be so like falling apart, tiny little chunks, <time_token_29> <time_token_29> is you don't brown it first, you're actually basically boiling it. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> So adding a beer, if you wanted to use beef broth or something instead, that would be fine, <time_token_31> <time_token_32> but we're gonna cook this so long, the alcohol is all gonna cook off anyway, so. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> And once I've got some in there, I'll start breaking it up a little bit. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> And then I'm gonna add some seasoning. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> So I've got here is just cumin, chili powder, a little bit of allspice, which is a little secret ingredient. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> I've got some paprika, because I want to make this extra red because, you know, of the flag and stuff. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> There's red on it. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> And some Worcestershire sauce. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> A few healthy glugs of that. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> And a little bit of dry mustard. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> You could also just use like some yellow prepared mustard if you don't have dry mustard. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Give it a little stir. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> I'm gonna add some tomato paste. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> I really just like this because it's fun to squirt it out. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> And I get to just like, deck it all up. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> So a couple tablespoons of tomato paste. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> And basically I'm just gonna bring this up to a simmer and let it simmer uncovered for about an hour. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Okay, one hour later, this is what we're looking at. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> I just stirred this about every 15 minutes or so. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> And now at the very end, give it a taste, add some salt if you think it needs it. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> But remember that hot dog's usually pretty salty too, so maybe you could undersalt it. <time_token_48> <time_token_50> I'm just gonna add a little touch, just a smidge of some apple cider vinegar. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> And I happen to love vinegar and sour things. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Not that that really makes this like sour, but I just think it makes it taste more like chili dog chili. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> But it's optional if you, you know, just give it a taste. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> If it seems a little bit like it needs a little perk, then try a little bit of vinegar. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> That's a good tip generally in life. <time_token_54> <time_token_56> Okay, move this aside and ta-da! <time_token_56> <time_token_56> I'm gonna show you my favorite way to cook hot dogs inside. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> So I've got my skillet here with a little bit of water in it. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> So I'm gonna throw a couple weenies in here. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> And basically I'm sort of combining the steam or boiled hot dog method with a little bit of a fry. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> So I'm gonna bring this up to a simmer and just kind of let these cook until the water evaporates. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> By then they'll be nice and warm and some of the fat will have rendered out. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> And then we'll let them sort of fry and crisp up in whatever fat is left in the pan. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> So just watch and see, it's gonna be magical. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Okay, so our water is almost evaporated off here a few minutes later. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> And I'm just gonna leave them in the dry pan now for just a couple seconds on each side to get the casing nice and crispy. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> Got my bun here. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> You could heat these up in the oven, wrapped up in foil, kind of get them steamed. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> So I like a little bit of cheese. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> I like to put the cheese down in between the chili and the hot dog to make sure it gets melted. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Cha, cha, cha, chili dog. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> See, this chili is great because it's nice and thick, so it's not like running out of the bun. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> It's just sort of staying where you put it. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> And it's not gonna make your bun like super wet and soggy. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> A little onion. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Because I like a spicy, I'm gonna do a little jalapeno. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> A little pickled jalapeno there. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> And then a little bloop, just like in the cartoons. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Okay, let's give it a taste of Rooney. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> That's just like a perfect little submarine of goodness. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Look at that. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Tell me you don't want to eat that right now. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Well, there you go.

On this episode of Laura in the Kitchen, I'm going to show <time_token_5> <time_token_6> you what I like to call my Italian BLT Panini. Now it's got the traditional elements of a <time_token_6> <time_token_8> BLT, but it is going to be fantastic. It's simple, it's quick, it's easy and let me show <time_token_8> <time_token_9> you the ingredients so we can get started. You're going to need some fresh spinach, some <time_token_9> <time_token_10> beautiful tomatoes, some fresh basil, some pancetta that's been thinly sliced, some <time_token_10> <time_token_12> pesto, your choice of bread, and then some shredded provolone. You can use mozzarella, <time_token_12> <time_token_13> you can use whatever you have on hand, but it just so happens that for me, I love using <time_token_13> <time_token_14> pancetta instead of bacon, which is more traditional for BLT, and instead of using, say, iceberg <time_token_14> <time_token_15> lettuce or any kind of lettuce, I like to use spinach because it's got lots and lots <time_token_15> <time_token_16> of great flavor and it's really good for us, and of course, you're going to have some <time_token_16> <time_token_17> beautiful tomatoes to go along with it. So what I'm going to do is make everything all <time_token_17> <time_token_18> in grill pan. You want to get your grill pan nice and hot, I have it over medium-high heat, <time_token_18> <time_token_20> and what I'm actually going to do, and this might sound a little bit odd, I'm going to <time_token_20> <time_token_21> take my thinly sliced pancetta and I'm just going to grill it for a couple minutes on <time_token_21> <time_token_22> each side to develop its flavor and a little bit of texture. And that's all I'm going to <time_token_22> <time_token_23> do for now, and it's going to take no time at all, it takes just about a minute per side. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> So go ahead and do that. I'm going to take my last two pieces off, and it literally takes <time_token_25> <time_token_26> just about a minute or so total. It doesn't take any time at all, but it really develops <time_token_26> <time_token_27> the flavor so it's a really important step that I wouldn't skip. But of course, if you <time_token_27> <time_token_28> don't have pancetta, which is really the Italian version of bacon, then you can just use bacon. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> So, on to assembling our sandwiches. Now what I do is take a couple of sizes of good quality <time_token_30> <time_token_31> bread, and I like to use a whole grain bread because I always have a whole grain on hand. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> That's my bread of choice. And I like to spread a thin, thin slice, but I have to have one <time_token_33> <time_token_35> teaspoon per slice of pesto. Now the reason why I'm using pesto is because traditionally <time_token_35> <time_token_36> you would use mayo, but you know, mayo's not that finger friendly, and I'm not a huge fan <time_token_36> <time_token_38> of mayo on my sandwiches. But if you like mayo, then by all means, knock yourself out. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> What I'm going to do is just spread this thin, flat smear of basil pesto onto each slice. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> Last one. Okay, now here's how she goes. Now I'm going to put a little bit of the shredded <time_token_42> <time_token_43> cheese underneath pretty much everything, so first slice is going to get a little bit <time_token_43> <time_token_44> of cheese, and this is going to be the topper, so don't worry about those two slices just <time_token_44> <time_token_45> yet. And the reason I'm putting cheese on the first slice and as well as the top is <time_token_45> <time_token_46> because it's going to act like glue, and it's going to kind of stick everything together. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> So that's, you know, that's why I'm using it that way. Then, going to pile on the tomatoes. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> You can just use whatever you want. Just season the tomatoes a little bit with some pepper. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> You do not need any salt because pancetta is so salty, it will be so overpowering, and <time_token_52> <time_token_54> then you'll be completely regretting that move. So just pile on your pancetta. It's <time_token_54> <time_token_56> so thinly sliced it's going to be amazing. I don't like to have like too thick of a piece <time_token_56> <time_token_57> of bacon or pancetta in my mouth because I think it's too overpowering and it's just <time_token_57> <time_token_58> nothing that you can taste anything else if you do that. A couple slices of bacon, of <time_token_58> <time_token_60> basil, and then I'm just going to put on a handful of some fresh, clean baby spinach. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> That's great. So, last thing, oops, I'm losing my spinach. Last thing I want to do is put <time_token_63> <time_token_65> a little bit more cheese on top because this is a top layer so it's like, remember it's <time_token_65> <time_token_67> like glue. You need something to hold it all together. That's fabulous. So now I'm just <time_token_67> <time_token_69> going to put a light drizzle of olive oil on my grill pan so that nothing sticks. Put <time_token_69> <time_token_70> the topper on and I'm just going to put them right on here. Those are going to be on for <time_token_70> <time_token_72> a few minutes on each side or until the cheese melts. Just flip it once and you're done. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> These look great. They've been on the grill for just about three minutes per side, just <time_token_74> <time_token_75> until the cheese melted. I'm actually going to bring this over to my board so I can cut <time_token_75> <time_token_77> it just like that. Oh yeah, look at that. Oh, I'm excited for this. That is awesome. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> It is so incredibly delicious. Now, pancitam, just listen to me. Get in your kitchen, make <time_token_79> <time_token_83> this sandwich because I guarantee it, once you do, you'll never make plain old BLTs ever <time_token_83> <time_token_85> again. I hope you enjoyed spending time with me. To get this recipe and others, go to www.laurainthekitchen.com. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> I'll see you next time. Bye-bye.

What we're going to do right now is spicy tuna roll, <time_token_2> <time_token_4> very popular on every sushi bar right in these days. We're going to first, <time_token_4> <time_token_6> we have cucumber avocado that we're going to need and we're going to make our spicy tuna <time_token_6> <time_token_8> and I'm going to show you how. And we have water to put it on our hands to be able to get the rice <time_token_8> <time_token_11> to get a little rice, make a shape of tamale in a hanobo shape. Then we have our toasted seaweed <time_token_11> <time_token_14> here, nori, and we're going to spread the rice first on the one leg, then <time_token_14> <time_token_16> more water if you need it. You can go just down this way and spread the rice all over the seaweed. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> And it puts a little of the sesame seeds. If you like the black ones, you can put some of the <time_token_19> <time_token_21> black ones too. I just don't like them because they have the burnt flavor. And the trick here is <time_token_21> <time_token_24> we have a wet towel that we're going to wet the cutting board a little bit so the rice won't stick <time_token_24> <time_token_26> in the cutting board with a couple of avocado slices, <time_token_26> <time_token_28> a couple of cucumber slices. You can put any vegetable one of course. Then we're going to do <time_token_28> <time_token_31> our spicy tuna. The spicy tuna is chopped, very fine. Then we're going to mix it with some of the <time_token_31> <time_token_33> sauce, the Vietnamese sauce. We've got a little teaspoon of Vietnamese sauce, the one with seeds. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> You can find this in almost every grocery store these days. And we're going to put some amount <time_token_35> <time_token_38> of sriracha, very popular too. Then chili oil, the sesame chili oil is very good. It's kind of hard <time_token_38> <time_token_40> to give a lot of good flavor to it. We put like a little half a teaspoon on it. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> Then it's all we're going to need it. We mix it very well. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> If you want a little hotter, of course you can put a little more chili oil. It's a lot of flavor <time_token_44> <time_token_45> and spices. We mix it very well. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> It takes for your patience. <time_token_48> <time_token_50> All right. Then okay, we're going to do our spicy tuna. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Sorry for the noise. <time_token_54> <time_token_56> We put some enough amount so we can be able to roll it. To roll it, you're going to take <time_token_56> <time_token_57> the edge with these two fingers. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> You thumb in the finger, of course, and your fingers. You're going to go this way. You push <time_token_59> <time_token_61> with these fingers, you push all this tuna in. Then roll it. First, you're going to, <time_token_61> <time_token_63> the first edge, you're going to make sure it goes right before the other edge. So when you roll it, <time_token_63> <time_token_67> this will hold it and not open. We have, we've rolled it already and then we're going to get <time_token_67> <time_token_70> a little plastic wrap. So the bamboo doesn't stick to it. <time_token_71> <time_token_73> You can find this almost in every grocery store right now. We'll find it online. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> So we're going to push one of the corners first, same with the other side, <time_token_75> <time_token_77> and push right in the middle, not the middle. You put the finger in the middle and the two <time_token_77> <time_token_79> corners with this too, like a little brush, not right in the middle because you're going to push <time_token_79> <time_token_82> everything out. This way, and we have it nice and square. To slice it, you put some water in your <time_token_82> <time_token_85> knife, go all over the blade so the blade is wet, and slice it on the middle. The water is to prevent <time_token_85> <time_token_88> the rice to stick to your knife. Slice in the middle and slice the middle of the other half, <time_token_88> <time_token_90> and you can just keep going that way, and you're going to have eight equal slices. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> See how beautiful it came out? <time_token_94> <time_token_97> All right, nice equal eight pieces. So you can put on a nice play and decorate it the way you want it. <time_token_98> <time_token_98> Thank you so much for watching this video.

special, healthy <time_token_2> <time_token_2> and make them at home, then this is the recipe for you. <time_token_2> <time_token_4> I'm going to show you how to make Singapore Noodles, it's so easy and best of all you <time_token_4> <time_token_4> can use lots of veggies and whack up your veggie content. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> So what we're going to start off with is chopping our veggies but I do need to tell you that <time_token_5> <time_token_6> I have marinated some chicken strips with a little bit of soy sauce, some oyster sauce <time_token_6> <time_token_7> and some garlic and ginger and you leave that to sit while you get on with the rest of your <time_token_8> <time_token_9> So time to chop my veggies, I'm going to start with my garlic so you just want a nice fine <time_token_9> <time_token_10> chop on your garlic and you don't have to be too careful but I do like when I do like <time_token_10> <time_token_11> Asian dishes that there's a nice kind of difference in texture so you've got a little bit of fine <time_token_11> <time_token_12> slicing going on. <time_token_12> <time_token_12> Lovely stuff, that's my garlic. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> With your ginger what you want to do is take off the skin so just run a knife around the <time_token_14> <time_token_14> sides of this. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> And just grab one of these babies, if you've never used one of these they're microplane <time_token_16> <time_token_17> graters and they are absolutely fantastic for getting the most out of your ginger or <time_token_17> <time_token_17> chilli and I'm going to use it for my ginger now. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> Give this one a good grate down, I'm using a lot of ginger because I love ginger and <time_token_19> <time_token_20> you do want to get a bit of a hit of it so about two thumb size pieces will do the job <time_token_20> <time_token_20> Right that's my ginger. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> So chop up the veggies, spring onions, celery and carrots and you can use whatever veggies <time_token_22> <time_token_23> you want here, peppers, aubergines, courgettes, it's up to you. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> I'm really giving my veggies a nice thin chop because they will cook much quicker. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> And now we're joined in the kitchen by the star of the show, Max the Dog everybody! <time_token_26> <time_token_27> Okay, he's just come because he thinks there's food so I better crack on and get his dinner <time_token_28> <time_token_29> Right, time to get that wok nice and hot. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> So heat goes on. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> Now the thing when you're making an Asian dish or any stir fry is to make sure that <time_token_31> <time_token_31> your wok is hot and that is the biggest mistake people make. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> The biggest mistake people make even. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> The reason you get a gloopy, sloppy stir fry is because your wok is not hot. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> If it's really hot like that you get this fiery heat that really cooks it nice and quick <time_token_34> <time_token_35> and that's exactly what I'm looking for now. <time_token_35> <time_token_35> So I'm going to let that heat up. <time_token_35> <time_token_37> I'm going to get a little drop of sunflower oil in there and you want to keep it heating <time_token_37> <time_token_38> until it just about starts smoking and when it starts smoking you know that it's nice <time_token_38> <time_token_38> and hot and ready to rock. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> We've got that lovely marinated chicken and this goes straight in. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> It does sizzle but stick with it. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> You need to make sure that your wok is nice and hot and as soon as that sizzle dies down <time_token_42> <time_token_43> you've got a beautiful cooking wok that isn't going to reduce in its heat. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> So give it a good mix through, fry it off and you want to cook this just until that <time_token_44> <time_token_44> chicken is just about cooked through. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> Right, come in here and check this out. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> We've got beautifully cooked chicken at this point. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> So this is the way you need it to be before you transfer it out. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> The chicken is nice and firm and it's cooked through. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> So transfer it over to a plate and get that pan straight back on the heat. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Add another little bit of olive oil or sunflower oil or rapeseed oil in. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> Little drop goes in and now you need to hit it with those great flavours. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> So I'm going to start off with a little bit of the garlic and ginger straight into the <time_token_52> <time_token_54> pan and give it a good mix through and as soon as those ginger and garlic pieces start <time_token_54> <time_token_55> to become aromatic you want to hit it with all those veggies. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> If you could smell this right now you would be making this for your dinner tonight. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> Try it out. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> Okay, veggies go in, pile our spring onions, our celery and our carrot in there and we've <time_token_59> <time_token_59> got some bean sprouts as well. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> And now all you need to do is mix it through. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> In with a drop of sesame oil for a nice nutty hit, about a teaspoon no more it's quite strong. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> And then some oyster sauce gives it a lovely rounded salty flavour and for both colour <time_token_64> <time_token_65> and saltiness I've got some dark soy sauce and do try and get the dark soy sauce here <time_token_65> <time_token_66> because it really does make a difference to the colour and the taste. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> There's a little bit of molasses in there so it really deepens the flavour. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Once those veggies are nice and tender but they still have a bite the chicken goes straight <time_token_68> <time_token_69> We're going to add in some pre-cooked noodles, you can use rice noodles, egg noodles, whatever <time_token_69> <time_token_69> you have yourself. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> And now the final ingredient, a little bit of curry powder, so get that in there. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> And you want to add that just at the last minute, a little bit extra for a little. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Mix that through. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> Oh and I have the best utensil to do this, hang on one sec, put it in my hands. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> This is the only way to mix through your noodles, so grab these babies and just get <time_token_76> <time_token_77> I don't know what you'd call these, I like to think of them as aardvark cans. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> So just mix through with those and get your noodles completely coated. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Okay now you don't want to overcook it so just whack off the heat, it's all gone very <time_token_79> <time_token_80> quiet and calm now. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> As soon as you turn off the heat it just kind of calms down a little bit. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> So tumble this out onto a nice big serving platter and look at that, these are serious <time_token_82> <time_token_83> You never have to dial the take away again, look, easy. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Last sprinkle of some spring onions over the top. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> And now all you have to do is taste it, so I'm going to grab a fork. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> This is worth waiting for, have a little swirl of noodle, a little bit of chicken, a little <time_token_87> <time_token_88> bit of veggies and give it a go. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> That is so good, it really is, I mean if you've ever made a stir fry and it hasn't worked <time_token_91> <time_token_92> out for you, give this recipe a go, it works every time, it's so tasty and I want you to <time_token_92> <time_token_93> The recipe is

I'm stepping away from what I normally do in my reviews on YouTube. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> I'm actually going to do something for a friend of mine who asked me for my recipe on kimchi. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> So I told them I would just make a quick YouTube video about it and put it on YouTube for them. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> So I understand if you subscribe, this could be a little bit different than what you're used to seeing. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> First of all, what you're going to need, you're going to need a large head of Napa cabbage. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> That Napa cabbage could go by Chinese cabbage, but normally at the grocery store it's called Napa cabbage. <time_token_6> <time_token_8> You're going to chop it up into bite-sized pieces, and then you're going to get three to four tablespoons of kosher salt or sea salt. <time_token_8> <time_token_10> You can't use regular salt, otherwise it'll kind of gum up and goop up at the top of the jar when you let it set in the refrigerator for several days. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> And so basically what you're going to do is you're going to put that on in layers. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> You're going to mix it in really well, put some on, put it in layers, mix it up real good again, then do another layer and repeat. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> Repeat that several times so you have the salt really mixed into the cabbage. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Okay, about an hour after you've chopped it up and you've let it set for a while, you'll notice that the fluid starts coming, <time_token_17> <time_token_18> the moisture starts coming out of the Napa cabbage. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> And once about one to two cups of fluid starts to accumulate in the bottom of the bowl, that's when you're going to be ready to rinse it out. <time_token_21> <time_token_23> The cabbage will still be crisp, but it'll look wilted and be kind of a little bit translucent. <time_token_24> <time_token_29> As you rinse and drain the cabbage, you're going to want to drain it very well the second time and try to squeeze out as much of the fluid as you can on that second try. <time_token_36> <time_token_38> Go ahead and get your green onions and your garlic ready. I tend to cut the tips off of the bottom of my green onions. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> It might not be any really good reason to do that. It's just something I saw my mom doing as I grew up. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> When you chop the green peppers up, please chop them into small pieces and then when you mince your garlic, again just to do a very fine mince on that garlic. <time_token_51> <time_token_56> Go ahead and take all your chopped green onions and garlic and throw them in the bowl with the cabbage in there and mix it up pretty well. <time_token_57> <time_token_62> I also forgot to mention, throw in two or three teaspoons of sugar and that will aid in the fermentation as well as add to the flavor. <time_token_62> <time_token_65> Once you have everything in your bowl, go ahead and grab, I like to use one cup of red pepper powder or not powder but crushed or ground red, Korean red pepper and you could use different amounts just depending on what your tastes are. <time_token_65> <time_token_67> There are some people that don't put any red pepper and then they make the white kimchi, but that's not what we're doing today. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> So put to your taste. What I like to do is I put a little bit in there, mix it up and then I put a little bit more in there. <time_token_80> <time_token_83> And once you've mixed in enough red pepper powder to get to your taste, I tend to let it set for another 5-10 minutes, kind of stir it up one more quick time and then put it in a jar. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> Once you put it in a jar, you're going to let it set. I like to let it set out for a day or two at room temperature, not outside and in my kitchen or somewhere like that before putting it in the refrigerator. <time_token_85> <time_token_87> Really, it's just like sauerkraut. The longer you let it set out and ferment, it's going to have more of a sour taste over time. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> I think it's more common that people let it set out 3-5 days. And really the benefit for this is there's some incredible probiotics that are just extremely healthy and good for you. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> You should Google it and read about the probiotic benefits of eating kimchi. It's just one of the super foods. It's just tremendously healthy for you. <time_token_91> <time_token_93> And again, that's really it. This is about how much one head of cabbage made and one head of napa cabbage made, made about a jar and a half of kimchi. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> And again, I made this video for one of my friends who asked me for my kimchi recipe. <time_token_94> <time_token_96> And so I'm not one of those people that really have precise measurements, as you can kind of see in my video. I just kind of throw it in there and kind of taste. <time_token_96> <time_token_98> Appreciate you checking out this video. Please like it. If you like it, that helps other people, helps me, helps people find the video, gives me a better ranking. <time_token_98> <time_token_98> Thank you very much and have a good day.

We're going to end our week with Bami's. We're going to make a <time_token_6> <time_token_9> Vietnamese chicken sandwich. We have a beautiful chicken breast that's been <time_token_9> <time_token_13> grilled. You can use chicken tenders if you want. We're going to make the start <time_token_13> <time_token_18> of our, once again, some, using regular red radishes this time, a little bit of <time_token_18> <time_token_25> sugar, some salt, and a little bit of vinegar, and this is going to be the base <time_token_25> <time_token_29> for this. Now we have to make a spread, so we have some, a little bit of fish sauce, <time_token_29> <time_token_34> a little bit of sesame oil, and a little bit of regular oil, along with some soy. <time_token_34> <time_token_37> Now you're going to mix this up, and what you're going to do is you're going to <time_token_37> <time_token_42> make, just like if you're making a salad dressing, okay? Just like you have the <time_token_42> <time_token_47> infamous Italian grinder. This is the same way. After this goes on, here's where <time_token_47> <time_token_53> the fun begins. Then you want to put a good spread of mayonnaise on this. Now we <time_token_53> <time_token_58> have lettuce. Now they use a lot of Boston lettuce, which is very, very tender. It <time_token_58> <time_token_65> works really well with their sandwiches. Then you take and add some onions to <time_token_65> <time_token_71> this. Then you're going to take and place the chicken breast fanned out any way you <time_token_71> <time_token_76> want. Then we're going to add some pick, some, just some regular jalapenos. I like <time_token_76> <time_token_81> that little bit of hot, some basil, and or cilantro. And then you're going to come <time_token_81> <time_token_88> along with your pickled vegetables on top, and the pickle is going to mix in <time_token_88> <time_token_92> with the lettuce. It really has a wonderful, wonderful flavor. So I hope you <time_token_92> <time_token_96> enjoyed this week of the bam mi sandwiches.

<time_token_24> <time_token_24> It's all a piece of bread. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> Like preserved bread-ish. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Also, this is for later use. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> You don't, you don't have to do this in the cooking. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Yes, you want to cook it. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> And here we have some rice noodle. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> You soak it in the water already. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> Yeah, and there's 30 minutes. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> For about 30 minutes. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> To make them soft, so your stir-fry will be a lot easier. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> Some bean sprouts this week. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Let's go into the kitchen. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> And about two tablespoons of vegetable oil. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> And you can find it in any tiny table like this. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> I'm going to crack the egg. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Like that, right? <time_token_38> <time_token_39> And now we're going to add the shrimp. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> The shrimp, yeah. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Or if you have chicken, you can just put it in right now. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> Or if anything is fine, but I love shrimp. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> We're going to put the noodles in. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> About, I would say, like, 1 cup of a cup. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> And then fine, too. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> The noodles become like soft. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> That's when you're ready to, you know, just put the pad thai sauce. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Put it on on fire. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> Make sure the noodles are soft. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Is it soft yet? <time_token_49> <time_token_49> It is pretty soft right now. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Just adding all the pad thai sauce that we need here. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> And then we just mix it into the noodles. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> Turn off the heat. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> I'm going to add the noodles ready. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Okay, so you're just going to get a little bit of that. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> A little bit of the cake out. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> I'm going to add the leaves. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> As well as the sprouts. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> And the nuts. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> Oh, this is not so good right now. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> So this recipe, so the audience can make by themselves at home, so. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> And if you can make it at home, and you're in New York City, what do you do? <time_token_61> <time_token_61> You have to tie to a fine check. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> I put it in the plate. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> I just want to give you some suggestion. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> When you're going to see pad thai sauce, that means pad thai is already soft. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> And then you can see everything mixed together. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> And guys, I just want to let you know that, again, I will put this recipe down in this box below. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Also, along with my articles that I've been writing about pad thai. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> And this article will be on Epic Time. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> Check it out. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> It's also going to be on Metro U.S. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> As well as my YouTube account. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> You can find me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> And I will also put Thai soups information down here. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> So check it out, guys. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Oh, I haven't eaten this. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Should we go out? <time_token_75> <time_token_75> So the moment of truth. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> I'm used first. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> I'm very respectful. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> I'm just kidding. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Isn't she like the girl used with you first? <time_token_78> <time_token_78> I'm just kidding. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> I'm going to taste first. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> Let me know if you like it. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> This is sweet. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> It's too sweet? <time_token_82> <time_token_82> It's supposed to be pad thai. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> It's supposed to be sweet and sour. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> But did I do a good job? <time_token_83> <time_token_83> You did a very good job. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> So if in my recommendation, I need more shinde. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Because I'm Thai, I'm light spicy. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Oh, more spices. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> But you can add more spices for you. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> And it's such a good job. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Because the noodles are really springy. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> It's really like chewy. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> In Chinese we call it hei q. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> And there's a really good balance between sweetness and sourness. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> It's really delicious. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> The only chance is it's going to be salty, right? <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Yeah, like it's everything. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> It's really good. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> But if I would cook this one more time, <time_token_95> <time_token_96> I also would add more spices. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> Anyhow, thanks for watching. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> And I'll see you in the next episode.

<time_token_1> Hi guys how is it going welcome to my virgin kitchen I am trying out my new camera today <time_token_1> <time_token_2> I used the gopro just the gopro actually on the last video you guys loved it so thanks <time_token_2> <time_token_3> very much for that the aim is to combine a little bit of what I did there with using <time_token_3> <time_token_4> this new camera and I am playing around with resolutions and stuff so bear with me this <time_token_4> <time_token_6> might not be how it finally looks but we will get there ok so today we are going to make <time_token_6> <time_token_7> some fafel nice easy chickpea kind of burger things in a pita wrap I am hungry for lunch <time_token_7> <time_token_9> and that is what we are going to do so hit pause on the video now and write them all <time_token_9> <time_token_10> down and let us make them right so for the fafel we are going to make it as easy as we <time_token_10> <time_token_11> can just by using our mini chopper thing if you have not got one of those you are going <time_token_11> <time_token_12> to have to chop away a lot right then folks here we are with all our ingredients that <time_token_12> <time_token_13> we are going to use to make those fafels I think that is how you pronounce it got some <time_token_13> <time_token_14> plain flour we are not using all that although it would be very very dry some chickpeas that <time_token_14> <time_token_15> have been drained off completely so it is just a chickpeas no water in there lemon half <time_token_15> <time_token_17> lemon juice half red onion garlic cloves coriander chilli pepper paprika and cumin <time_token_17> <time_token_18> that is all going boom right in there right it is nearly all in there now I am very close <time_token_18> <time_token_19> to the edge I probably need to get a bigger one of these but there we go I am going to <time_token_19> <time_token_20> sprinkle the flour on there just about one and a half tablespoons if you can get a bit <time_token_20> <time_token_22> more in there it all goes let us squeeze on a little bit of that lemon juice oh yeah and <time_token_22> <time_token_23> then we are going to get the lid on it right so on goes the lid and let us give it some <time_token_23> <time_token_25> whirly action right so with your mixture all done it should look something like that <time_token_25> <time_token_26> all nice and colourful and funky we are going to get it down there on a chopping board right <time_token_26> <time_token_27> now yeah this is a messy bit so I am a little bit worried about hitting the pause button <time_token_27> <time_token_28> on my camera any minute now but you do not need to worry about that so what I have got <time_token_28> <time_token_29> is a little bit in my hands like so and I am just going to shape it it does hold its <time_token_29> <time_token_30> shape quite well actually that is why you need to make sure it is kind of dry and you <time_token_30> <time_token_31> drain those chickpeas properly baby make them into little ball shapes like this and then <time_token_31> <time_token_32> you can have them like a ball shape or maybe just squish them down a little bit like that <time_token_32> <time_token_33> do that to all of your stuff now I have got to press that button ok so with the falafels <time_token_33> <time_token_34> I have only made six for the moment which is plenty as it is just me here at the moment <time_token_34> <time_token_36> that would do nicely but you have actually got enough to make double that so six times <time_token_36> <time_token_37> two equals twelve do you like how I did my maths there kind of cool right so rather than <time_token_37> <time_token_38> frying them straight away which you can do we are just going to push them to one side <time_token_38> <time_token_39> and just work on our salad bits which will not take very long at all ok then folks so <time_token_39> <time_token_40> into this bowl I am going to put some spinach and rocket leaves big handful of chopped parsley <time_token_40> <time_token_42> oh yeah these are my leftover bits of parsley one spring onion and three cherry tomatoes <time_token_42> <time_token_44> all sliced push that all in oh yeah baby I am just going to trim some crests like maybe <time_token_44> <time_token_45> half a punnet getting it everywhere just on top of there a bit awkward there just washed <time_token_45> <time_token_46> it and it is dripping do not really want the soil in there no no no no good squeeze of <time_token_46> <time_token_48> lemon juice say another half oh yeah and a grind in a pepper like a teaspoon or maybe <time_token_48> <time_token_49> a little more if you are feeling kinky then I am just going to get my hands in there combine <time_token_49> <time_token_50> it all together and that is going to really compliment those falafelafelafelafelafelafel <time_token_50> <time_token_52> there we go that will do nicely you want to smell it oh yeah ok folks once you reach <time_token_52> <time_token_53> this stage and you have got your salad ready and you have got your falafels sat there <time_token_53> <time_token_54> doing their thing the only other thing to do really is get your pizza bread so like <time_token_54> <time_token_55> a pizza bread barara maybe not ok I just got a toaster that is a boring step so I <time_token_55> <time_token_56> am not going to show you that we are going to go straight on to frying up our falafelafelafelafel <time_token_57> <time_token_58> alright so I am just getting a flame there and I am going to warm up my pan like so a <time_token_58> <time_token_60> little bit of olive oil, sunflower oil, vegetable oil not engine car oil that would be bad alright <time_token_60> <time_token_61> that oil is nice and hot now but just to show you the pizza bread has been all nice and <time_token_61> <time_token_62> toasted and they have actually increased in volume a little bit so I am letting them cool <time_token_62> <time_token_63> down a teeny weeny bit but anyhow lets just sit these in there oh yeah can you hear that <time_token_63> <time_token_64> sizzling nice and gentle so they are going to take about two or three minutes either <time_token_64> <time_token_65> side and then we will flip them and then we can build them right so once they are done <time_token_65> <time_token_67> they should look a little bit like that nice and browned on the tops both sides and in <time_token_67> <time_token_68> the middle they are still going to be yummy and squishy so what we are going to do now <time_token_68> <time_token_69> is stuff them in our pizza breads with our salad and maybe a little bit of sweet chilli <time_token_69> <time_token_70> sauce good times there is my thumb good times sorry. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Alright folks as you can see I have already made one so what I did was grabbed a bit of <time_token_71> <time_token_72> bread like so and stuffed it it is kind of like a mouth hello I am just stuffing a load <time_token_72> <time_token_74> of salad in there first of all tucking in the falafels just sitting them in like that <time_token_74> <time_token_75> and I am going to ram a lot more salad in there as well right on top of it like this <time_token_75> <time_token_76> cram it right in there oh my goodness and then finish it with a cheeky drizzle of sweet <time_token_76> <time_token_77> chilli sauce oh my goodness I want to put that in my mouth right away. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Right folks thanks for putting up for me for this video I know I have been a little bit <time_token_79> <time_token_80> serious but I am trying to understand the camera for example the last five minutes I <time_token_80> <time_token_80> just spent trying to take a picture and it would not work so I need to read the manual <time_token_80> <time_token_81> and when I was doing that I took a big old bite and oh my goodness these are amazing <time_token_84> <time_token_84> I am going to have another bite right now. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> It is like a head nodding pita bread I am loving the chickpeas I do not know if the <time_token_84> <time_token_86> chick is a feminine reference or maybe it is like a chicken reference I am loving it <time_token_86> <time_token_87> and maybe it is latin for like peas of love maybe chickpeas equals peas of love I do <time_token_87> <time_token_87> not know I am loving it I am going to have another bite. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> So good so quick so easy you can have that for lunch it is nice and light and healthy <time_token_89> <time_token_90> and it is vegetarian as well crazy so if I can make that absolutely anyone in the world <time_token_90> <time_token_92> can have a go for yourself let me know how you are on and I will see you again on the <time_token_92> <time_token_93> next video we will

<time_token_3> They look fantastic, they taste awesome and one of the reasons is because we're putting <time_token_3> <time_token_4> some roasted peppers in. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> We got two poblano peppers and one green bell pepper. <time_token_6> <time_token_8> We took out the ribs and the seeds, sliced them in half, then we greased the pan and <time_token_8> <time_token_10> put the peppers cut side down and then baked them at 400 degrees for about a half an hour. <time_token_11> <time_token_13> When roasting the peppers like this here, it's going to make the outside dark and a <time_token_13> <time_token_14> little bubbly and then when you pull it out of the oven while they're still hot, cover <time_token_14> <time_token_16> them up and let them steam in their own heat for about 10 or 15 minutes. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> This is going to loosen up the skin and it will peel right off, you know, when you want <time_token_18> <time_token_18> to peel it off because it's kind of plasticky. <time_token_18> <time_token_21> But what you're going to be left with is these awesome roasted peppers, they taste fantastic <time_token_21> <time_token_23> and you can use them in any kind of recipe but they're great with a burrito filling, <time_token_23> <time_token_25> you know, so just dice them up and then we'll get to work on the rest of this filling. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> We're using a little bit of ground beef, we're going to go ahead and brown it up in a skillet. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> If you don't want to use beef, you know, just use a lot of beans but we like the taste of <time_token_28> <time_token_31> the ground beef with the onion and garlic, a lot of onion, a lot of garlic, you know, <time_token_31> <time_token_33> throw it in here while this meat's browning up and then we're going to add some beans <time_token_33> <time_token_34> We're using one can of kidney beans and then one can of dog food. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> If you don't want to use dog food, then just use some refried beans, you know, it's basically <time_token_36> <time_token_37> the same thing. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> Now we're throwing in most of our roasted peppers, we're going to reserve about a quarter <time_token_39> <time_token_42> of it, you know, to use as a topping later and then we're getting off the heat, throwing <time_token_42> <time_token_44> in our seasoning, some chili powder, cumin, salt and pepper, mixing it up and then that's <time_token_44> <time_token_45> We can go ahead and roll it up in some tortillas now. <time_token_45> <time_token_47> So we're greasing our pan, you know, that we're going to put our burritos in and then <time_token_47> <time_token_48> we're going to overstuff them. <time_token_48> <time_token_50> You know, camera girl always puts two heaping spoonfuls on here, you know, tops it with <time_token_50> <time_token_52> a little bit of cheese and then rolls it up, you know, she makes it look easy, but it's <time_token_52> <time_token_54> It's, you know, it's a skill and you're going to learn it by practicing. <time_token_54> <time_token_57> You know, let's take

look, amazing. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> She always jam packs it full because we like a lot of burritos and then she's got some <time_token_62> <time_token_63> She's going to go ahead and spread a little bit of that on top. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> You know, she's going to put some salsa. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> This is homemade salsa. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> You don't have to use homemade salsa. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> You can use like a jarred salsa. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> If you're a caveman, you know, then the rest of our roasted peppers and a little more cheese, <time_token_68> <time_token_70> you want to make the top look like a Mexican Christmas tree, right? <time_token_70> <time_token_72> And now we'll take the whole pan of burritos, slide it in the oven, still at 400 degrees <time_token_73> <time_token_75> let it bake away for about 30 or 40 minutes, you know, what you're looking for is for the <time_token_75> <time_token_76> edges to start to brown up. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> Once they start to brown around the edges, go ahead and turn your oven to broil and then <time_token_78> <time_token_79> broil it for about three or four or five minutes, something like that. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> But watch it like a hawk because you don't want to burn the top. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> You just want to toast it, you know, get a nice toasty cheese topping on there. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> And then there you have it, man, boom, fantastical burritos. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> We're serving it up with some sour cream and some salad and homemade guacamole. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> CG's burrito recipe. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Go ahead and give this a try.

Tonight we will be preparing shrimp <time_token_1> <time_token_3> shiska bars. I'm excited let's get started. A bowl of shrimp and you add some <time_token_3> <time_token_5> olive oil just enough to coat it just enough to coat the pan and I'm gonna <time_token_5> <time_token_6> take some garlic some bell peppers and some purple onions that I'm going to <time_token_6> <time_token_7> put on the shiska bar. I'm going to take a small portion of it and roughly chop <time_token_7> <time_token_8> it up. We're just going to roughly chop it up to add to the bowl. What you're <time_token_8> <time_token_9> going to do is you're going to add the peppers, the bell pepper, the red, the <time_token_9> <time_token_11> yellow, the orange, bell pepper. Roughly chop, don't have to be finely chopped, just <time_token_11> <time_token_12> roughly chopped. This is pieces to marinate into the olive oil and you're <time_token_12> <time_token_14> going to place it in a refrigerator for about 30 minutes or longer. You're just <time_token_14> <time_token_15> seasoning the shrimp with your raw vegetables. Just roughly chop them up <time_token_15> <time_token_17> nothing fancy, not too small, not too big. You add it to your bowl with your <time_token_17> <time_token_19> shrimp and it's just olive oil and shrimp and I've taken and created my own <time_token_19> <time_token_20> little Creole seasoning. I've added some parsley, some basil, some oregano, some <time_token_20> <time_token_22> cayenne pepper, some garlic powder, some onion powder. Can you see that? And I <time_token_22> <time_token_23> just added that one-fourth of a teaspoon to it and I'm going to add it to my <time_token_23> <time_token_26> mixture and I'm going to refrigerate this 30 minutes to an hour. Now I've had <time_token_26> <time_token_27> some that's actually been marinating in the refrigerator. So what I'm going to do <time_token_27> <time_token_29> actually I'm going to take and cut up my bell peppers that I'm going to put on <time_token_29> <time_token_30> the shish kubab and I'm just going to make nice little squares enough to what <time_token_30> <time_token_32> I used to say to let the vegetables hug the shrimp. So what I'm going to do is <time_token_32> <time_token_33> I'm actually going to take a purple onion and put on the end, put on first <time_token_33> <time_token_34> facing up and then I'm going to take a shrimp that's been marinating in the <time_token_34> <time_token_36> olive oil in the seasoning and I'm going to add the shrimp to the cisco bob stick <time_token_36> <time_token_37> which you can buy these in any supermarket. They are everywhere and then <time_token_37> <time_token_39> I'm going to add a pepper. I'm going to add a shrimp and then I'm just going to <time_token_39> <time_token_40> continue with shrimp, vegetable, onion, shrimp, vegetable until I fill it up with <time_token_40> <time_token_42> how many vegetables and shrimp that I want on the stick. So I usually of these <time_token_42> <time_token_43> jumbo shrimp, let me see if you can see them, of these jumbo shrimp I usually have <time_token_43> <time_token_44> like four, four on the stick. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Try to make it a little colorful by adding the different color bell peppers in between. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> So you can put three or four however many you like and I'm going to just add these <time_token_49> <time_token_51> three shrimp on here and then I'm going to add it to a bowl that I have, well a <time_token_51> <time_token_52> baking pan that I'm going to just lightly olive roll it. I'm going to add, place the <time_token_52> <time_token_54> cisco bob stick like so. Let's see if you can see that. That's all I'm doing. I'm going to do <time_token_54> <time_token_55> another one and this time I'm going to start with the bell pepper. Last time I <time_token_55> <time_token_56> started with a purple onion. It really doesn't matter however you would like to <time_token_56> <time_token_56> do it, it'll work. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> And like I said you just keep adding shrimp, bell pepper, onion until you feel <time_token_60> <time_token_61> your stick and these are going to be delicious. I promise you. I know I'm <time_token_61> <time_token_62> always promising that something's going to be delicious but you will thoroughly <time_token_62> <time_token_62> enjoy these, I do. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> Yes, these are going to be delicious. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> I always end with a shrimp and then we're going to add that and we're going to add <time_token_69> <time_token_71> another shrimp on here. These are going to be delicious. Then I will take the <time_token_71> <time_token_72> marinade that I have that it was sitting in and I would just slightly pour it on <time_token_72> <time_token_73> top because that's really where all the flavor is and then my remaining I'm <time_token_73> <time_token_75> going to sprinkle on top. And it's like I said, it's garlic powder, cayenne pepper, <time_token_75> <time_token_76> oregano, basil, 1 fourth tablespoon. Then I'm going to place these in the oven and <time_token_76> <time_token_76> these are going to be delicious. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> So they will be in the oven for about 20 minutes. You're going to cook them on each <time_token_84> <time_token_86> side for 10 minutes each. Then you take them out and when you take them out they <time_token_86> <time_token_87> will look like this. Let's see, can you see that? <time_token_87> <time_token_88> These are some that are finished and can I tell you, <time_token_88> <time_token_90> you will really enjoy these delicious cisca bobs. A simple recipe, very simple. <time_token_90> <time_token_92> All you do is you add your vegetables of your choice, add some seasoning, some <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Creole seasoning, when in my case I added cayenne pepper, basil, thyme, garlic powder, <time_token_93> <time_token_94> 1 fourth tablespoon of it and I sprinkled it on. The first time I marinated it in some <time_token_94> <time_token_95> olive oil and some onions and bell peppers for about 30 minutes. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> When I say delicious, delicious. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> Until next time, thanks for watching. I'm going to enjoy these. Bye.

beauty of making this yourself is that you can control how hot or how sour it is <time_token_1> <time_token_2> and how thick it is by the ingredients that you add. <time_token_2> <time_token_4> So the first thing you want to do is reconstitute some black fungus mushrooms and this is what <time_token_4> <time_token_5> they look like when they're dry and I probably have about two tablespoons, just like a little <time_token_5> <time_token_6> handful here and I'm going to pour some boiling water over them just to cover them. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> And our next step is to shred up the chicken and I just want to show you how I do it. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> I have two chicken breast halves boneless here and I push down with my hand and then <time_token_12> <time_token_13> I push the knife through gently about a third of the way down and you get a thin slice like <time_token_13> <time_token_15> that and I'm going to do that again half way down and I should get three nice thin slices <time_token_15> <time_token_16> and if you want to cut them thinner you can do another slice, it depends on the size of <time_token_16> <time_token_16> your chicken breast. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> And now the grain is going this way so I'm just going to cut off little shreds like this <time_token_17> <time_token_18> and you can do this as thick or as thin as you like, I like thin shreds. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> If you wanted to do a larger piece you could do this and you get really nice thin pieces <time_token_21> <time_token_22> I just want to show you again, I'm holding my blade at about a 45 degree angle and I'm <time_token_22> <time_token_22> pushing it away from me. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> That helps me get a thin slice. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> You could do this with pork too, I prefer it with the chicken but if you want to do <time_token_24> <time_token_24> the pork you could do the same thing, now I'm going to finish shredding this up. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> You need a sharp knife and then when you're putting your knife through the breast this <time_token_26> <time_token_27> way just be very careful not to slice your hand, you'll kind of feel where the knife <time_token_27> <time_token_28> is, where the chicken is and where your hand is I hope and you also want a sharp knife <time_token_28> <time_token_30> So I'm going to put this in the bowl here and I have three tablespoons of soy sauce <time_token_30> <time_token_32> and I'm going to mix this in and see if it's enough to cover it and if you have more chicken, <time_token_32> <time_token_33> if you have larger chicken breasts you might want a little bit more soy sauce but it looks <time_token_33> <time_token_34> like it's covering it here so we're good and now I'm going to sprinkle an equal amount <time_token_34> <time_token_35> I have three tablespoons of cornstarch and I'm just going to mix that in with my hand <time_token_36> <time_token_37> and I'm going to drizzle a little bit of toasted sesame oil on here as well. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> It's probably a teaspoon. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> Okay, our chicken's ready so I'm going to let it marinate while I chop up the rest of <time_token_40> <time_token_41> So I've drained my mushrooms and they're nice and reconstituted now and I'm just going to <time_token_41> <time_token_43> take a few and I stack them up one on top of the other and you just cut them into little <time_token_43> <time_token_44> strips as thin as you can get them or if you want them thicker you can cut them thicker <time_token_44> <time_token_45> but I like to cut them into little strips like that and I'm going to do it with the <time_token_45> <time_token_45> rest of them. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> I have a 12 ounce block of extra firm tofu here. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> You can use a softer tofu if you prefer and I don't think I'm going to use the whole thing. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> I'm just going to start chopping and I'll see when to stop. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> It's up to you how much tofu you like. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> I'm going to cut half of it first. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> So I cut it into these slices here and I stack them up and then I'm just going to chop down <time_token_51> <time_token_51> and I'm going to get these little strips. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> I think I'll do it. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Now I'll leave them like this. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> I don't want them to fall apart. <time_token_52> <time_token_54> I have an 8 ounce can of sliced bamboo shoots that I've drained and I'm going to slice them <time_token_54> <time_token_55> into little strips like this. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> I'm going to do it for all of them. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> I'm going to use up the whole can because I don't really have a use for the bamboo shoots <time_token_56> <time_token_57> other than in this recipe but if you want to use less it's up to you. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> You can use less. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> So I've brought up about 8 or 9 cups of chicken stock to a boil and I'm going to add the chicken, <time_token_58> <time_token_59> the mushrooms, the bamboo shoots and the tofu and I'm going to cook them for a few <time_token_59> <time_token_59> minutes until the chicken is cooked through. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> So the chicken is cooked through. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> It doesn't take long because it's shredded very thin. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> I'm going to add a quarter cup of soy sauce. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> I'm using low sodium. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> You can use full sodium and I have a quarter cup of rice vinegar. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> I have 2 teaspoons of salt and 3 teaspoons of sugar but you want to taste your stock. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> See how salty it is and how salty you want it. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> You might not want to add any salt because the sodium from the soy sauce is probably <time_token_64> <time_token_65> plenty for most people. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Now I'm going to add some white pepper and I'm going to do that to taste. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> It's very hot so just be careful but you can just add a little bit, taste and see if it's <time_token_67> <time_token_67> hot enough for you and then I'll show you the next step. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> So I added about a teaspoon of white pepper to mine. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> It's pretty spicy so you really just have to taste it and see how much is enough for <time_token_69> <time_token_69> Just go slow. <time_token_69> <time_token_71> Now I have 2 tablespoons of cornstarch that I diluted in a half a cup of cold water and <time_token_71> <time_token_71> I'm going to add this to the soup and it should thicken it up. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> If it's not thick enough for you, you can add a little bit more cornstarch. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> I'm going to let it cook for a while and I'll check if it's thick enough for me. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> So I ended up adding another tablespoon of cornstarch that I diluted with a tiny bit <time_token_74> <time_token_74> of cold water. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> It thickens it. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> It makes it almost that gelatinous consistency that you're used to getting at the Chinese <time_token_75> <time_token_76> restaurants but I don't like it too goopy and it also depends on how much cornstarch <time_token_76> <time_token_77> you ended up putting on your chicken and how thick your soup is going to get. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Now I'm going to add some beaten eggs which will also thicken it a little bit. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I have 2 eggs that I gently beat with a fork and I'll show you how to add them in a second. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> Now I skimmed a little bit of the foam off the top of the soup and I'm going to reduce <time_token_80> <time_token_81> the flame a little bit but I don't want it boiling that hard. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> Now I'm just going to gently add the egg and as I do it slowly I just gently stir. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> I'm using a fork. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> You can use chopsticks or whatever you want. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> You just want to gently stir it and you'll get these little ribbons of egg. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> You don't want to do it too vigorously because then you'll just incorporate the egg completely <time_token_86> <time_token_89> into the soup so just do it slowly and slowly stir and you'll get these, it drops. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Now I'm going to maybe let it stand for I don't know 20 seconds just until the eggs <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Now maybe even less I think I might turn it off in a few seconds and when I do that I'm <time_token_91> <time_token_92> going to drizzle some toasted sesame oil into it to taste. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Depends how much you like sesame oil but I think it makes a soup really good. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> So I'm going to put in some sesame oil and I'll show you the next step. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Okay so I've turned it off and I drizzled about 2 tablespoons of sesame oil and now <time_token_95> <time_token_96> I'm just going to add a whole bunch of scallions that I chopped up and I saved a little bit <time_token_96> <time_token_97> for garnishing the bowl

<time_token_11> <time_token_12> This is my mom's original spaghetti pot. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> That's right, it's got all the dings, all the scratch marks. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> This is my mom's pot. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> And I saw the lid for it too, which is all dented. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> But it always tastes better when it's in mom's pot. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> Okay, so let's take a look here. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> We're going to bring you into the stove and we're just going to show you how to put this <time_token_16> <time_token_17> If you've had pasta basil before, you will know like at Olive Garden, they put ground <time_token_17> <time_token_17> pork in it or ground beef in it. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> You can make different variations. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> I have no meat in this recipe for you vegetarians out there that don't want meat or can't have <time_token_19> <time_token_19> it or you're allergic to it or whatever it is. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> So you can add meat to this, not a problem, it'll be just as good, even more delicious, <time_token_20> <time_token_21> You go with the kidney beans, first thing to go in, you want all the juice and everything, <time_token_21> <time_token_21> Put the kidney beans in there. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> There you go. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> If you like kidney beans, put a second can in, you want to throw white beans in there, <time_token_23> <time_token_23> That's where you can make your variations. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> I have the light red beans, do whatever you want, okay? <time_token_24> <time_token_24> Then you're just going to take this over to the sink and rinse it out. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Not a full can of water, but just kind of swish it around to get all that flavor out <time_token_25> <time_token_25> of the can. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> Here we go. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> Don't forget the recipe is down below, so you don't have to write this down. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> We're going to pour the puree in. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> Then we're going to start filling up cans of water, okay? <time_token_28> <time_token_29> We're going to put in a few cans of water, once again, check below for the amount of <time_token_29> <time_token_30> water, but we're going to get all that goodness out of there and we're going to add some water <time_token_30> <time_token_30> to the soup. <time_token_32> <time_token_32> All right, once again, here's your variation. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> I put in five cans of water because that's what the recipe asked for and I'm used to <time_token_33> <time_token_33> If you like it stronger, leave one of the cans of water out, okay? <time_token_33> <time_token_34> It makes a thicker soup and much more flavor. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Okay, now it's time to put in some oregano, and when I always do, I always tap it. <time_token_35> <time_token_35> Tap the side. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> You don't glop too much. <time_token_36> <time_token_38> You look at it at about one, one and a half to two tablespoons, and there's the basil. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> There we go. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> Now, here's the key. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> This is another interesting part of my mom's soup. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> She didn't put a lot of salt in, she just put a little bit in. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> She always told us you're going to have to salt it at the table, so this will need salt, <time_token_42> <time_token_42> but just put a little bit of salt in there just to bring up the flavors. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> But I promise you, at the table, you'll probably want to add salt and just a little black pepper. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> There you go. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> I got the wet garlic, so I'm going to do two heaping tablespoons because we're Italian. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Whoops, sorry about that. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> There we go. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> Get all the garlic off the spoon, too. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> This is a fresh ingredient I like to put in. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> My mom used to do dried minced onions, but I'm just doing fresh, so be sure to put in <time_token_50> <time_token_51> some onions, too, into the batch, okay? <time_token_51> <time_token_51> And then just let that simmer. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> You're going to let that simmer like a soup, so once it starts bubbling and boiling and <time_token_52> <time_token_53> all the flavors get together, you should be good to go. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> The onions will soften up. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> While you're waiting for it to simmer, get this going. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Let's get the macaroni cooked because this ain't going to take long. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> Macaroni's probably going to take longer, so get that water boiling and let's get the <time_token_55> <time_token_56> elbow macaroni cooked, too. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> Okay, first thing we're going to do, we got the macaroni all cooked. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> We're going to put some of the macaroni in the bowl, then you steal some of the soup <time_token_63> <time_token_63> with a big ladle. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Now you can cook this down a little bit more if you want it thicker, but I'm making it <time_token_64> <time_token_64> how mom made it. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> You've got to taste it and make sure it doesn't need any salt or pepper, it may need a little <time_token_65> <time_token_65> bit more salt. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> But one of the things we did as kids, a little Tabasco. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> That's right, Tabasco sauce is amazing. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> Oh my goodness, I feel like I'm 10 years old again. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> This is an amazing comfort food. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Once again, it's inexpensive. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> Hold on, wait, hold on, I want to get a kidney bean right there, there we go. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> It's really good. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> If you like it thicker, I would add paste or just cook it down longer. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> I like it a little soupy, so it's really good. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> Mmm, mmm, oh yeah, that Tabasco just comes right out. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> It's really good. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Bread and butter, I even sprinkle cheese on top, melt some cheese on top. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Now don't forget, next week's our big episode. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> That's right, it's my short rib marinade, excuse me, it's my mom's short rib marinade <time_token_78> <time_token_78> I'm not supposed to give it away, but I'm giving away the formula. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I was going to bottle this, but you know what?

the old favourite, bangers and mash. <time_token_1> <time_token_1> So let's get cooking on Mooney's Kitchen. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> Okay, the first thing we need to do is get our potatoes onto mash. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> I've got four large potatoes and I've just cut them into quarters. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> Top them up with water. <time_token_8> <time_token_8> That's your salt. <time_token_8> <time_token_8> You can get them onto boil. <time_token_9> <time_token_9> Into another pot, you want to pour the peas, as much or as little peas as you like. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> A little bit of salt. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> A couple of sprigs of meat, straight in. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> And a good old dash of sugar, probably around about a tablespoon and a half of sugar. <time_token_12> <time_token_12> Bring these up to the boil. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> And then once they're nice and soft, we're just going to mash a little bit of butter. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> Now, there's no secret about cooking sausages, but if you're doing them inside, <time_token_13> <time_token_14> I'll just put a touch of oil in there so they don't stick. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> Around about half a teaspoon. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> That's all you'll need, just enough to coat the pan. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Now, while the peas and the potatoes are bubbling away there and a nice gentle simmer, <time_token_16> <time_token_16> I'm going to add my sausages to the pan. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> I'm just using a thin meat sausage. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> It's very cheap. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> You can use whatever sausage you like. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> It's your preference. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Now, just give it a gentle turn. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Make sure you eat them nice and low. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> And you're just going to cook them until they're the way that you like them. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Now, I don't add salt to sausages because usually there's enough salt in there, <time_token_20> <time_token_21> but I'm going to add just a little bit of cracked pepper, and that's just going to help it in the seasoning. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> All right, so the sausage is cooking away beautifully. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> While I'm taking a bit of a noise, that's always a good sign. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> Now, I've sliced half an onion, just a regular brown onion, and I'm going to put that in. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> That's more than cooked usually. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> Just a nice bit of cutting there. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> If it's a dried herb, you can use basil or regular herb. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> If you want to use cracked herbs, go ahead. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> And I just want to just, just a little sprinkle. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> Don't go mad. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> And we want to now keep the pan here to stay. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> And while that's well, it's cooked. <time_token_30> <time_token_30> I mean, on the bottom of the pan, I'm going to take the spot of these up <time_token_30> <time_token_31> and nestle the bottom of the top of the onion, like that. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Now, our sausages are pretty much cooked, so we're going to take those out of the pan. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> And we're going to now make our gravy, our sauce that's going to go with this beautiful thing as a mash. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> I'm going to add a couple of tablespoons of just chopped tomato, maybe three. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> And just let everything legal and get to very dry. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> Make sure now that you have it on a low heat. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> I'm going to add a splash of Worcestershire sauce, a good splash of that. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> And I want that just to reduce down, probably around about two tablespoons. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> I'm going to add about a half a cup of beef stock. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> I just want to let that reduce down. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> Let it all cook and mingle together. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> At this stage, you can add any herbs you like, parsley, a little bit of sage, <time_token_43> <time_token_44> whatever you've got growing in the garden. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> I've got some mint in the peas. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> I don't want to go over the top with all these flavours. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> Okay, now we're ready for the secret ingredient. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Now, wood smoked, flavoured barbecue sauce. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> This is the first time I've seen this. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> There is another HP sauce, and I think it's, I'm not sure what the flavour is, but there is now two of these. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> This is the first one, the smoked one. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> We're going to hit this sauce with a good squirt of this smoked HP barbecue sauce. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> That's really going to kick in and give it that smoky flavour. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> Now, this is the first time I've used it, so I'm not sure how much to use. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> I'm giving it a bit of a good squirt. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> I'd say about three tablespoons. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> Don't need to do anything else now. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> What I'm going to do is I'm going to sit the sausages back into the sauce. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> That's going to keep them nice and hot. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> I'm going to turn my gas off so that my sauce doesn't reduce down anymore. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Okay, the mash is out. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> I've drained it. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> I'm going to put the pot back on the stove just to heat through, and when I put the potatoes back in, <time_token_55> <time_token_55> it's going to suck out any more moisture that's in there. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> In we go with a couple of knobs of butter, about two tablespoons of butter. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> I've cut them nice and thin. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Cracked black pepper, a little bit of salt, and my old mate grated nutmeg. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> Can't have potato without nutmeg. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> Well, you can. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> It's up to you. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> But it's such a beautiful thing to add. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> I love it. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> While the pan's still hot, I'm just going to drizzle a bit of milk in there, just a touch. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Really, you should warm this milk up and add it after you've mashed them, but I think we'll be right. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Now, I've done this recipe in less than half an hour, and I know I have because my kids, <time_token_63> <time_token_64> my wife's taking my kids swimming, and they're going to be back, and their swimming lesson's about half an hour, <time_token_64> <time_token_65> and give them ten minutes to get changed, and I'll have tea done. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Give it a good mix. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Now, I've mashed it with the masher, just to give it a good whisk. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> This is going to get all those lumps out. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> Don't over whisk it, because then you'll end up with a gluten mess. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Just want to give it a fine whisk there. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> I promise you, you will have a smooth mashed potato. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Okay, onto our minted puree, or minted peas. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Take the mint out now. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Now, I've drained the peas. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> I'm just going to pour them back into the pot. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Just add a knob of butter, a little bit of salt, some pepper. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Now, if you want to leave them whole, please do so. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> I'm just going to mash them. <time_token_77> <time_token_80> There you have it. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> You wouldn't think that something as simple as this could look so great, <time_token_80> <time_token_81> and I can tell you what, it's beautiful. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Pea puree, it's got some nice, I've got my knife and fork here. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> I'm ready to try it. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Beautiful, soft velvety mashed potato underneath. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> You've got that sausage. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> It doesn't need to be a fancy sausage, although you could step it up <time_token_84> <time_token_85> if you want to add a little bit more flavor using a pork sausage or whatever. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> But I've just done the traditional just beef sausage and made it look great. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> I'm going to try this, and the addition of that HP sauce, <time_token_86> <time_token_87> I hope you give this a try. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> You should be able to get HP sauce. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> If we can get it in Australia, I'm sure that you can get it overseas in America <time_token_88> <time_token_88> and definitely in the UK. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> So I've got a beautiful mashed potato. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Now, we'll just add a little bit of the pea puree. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> And we've got that beautiful fresh mint just bursting through. <time_token_91> <time_token_93> Lovely onion, the tomato, and the addition of HP original <time_token_93> <time_token_94> wood-smoked flavored barbecue sauce. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> It's just something a little bit different. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> I hope you give this one a try. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> This one's a nice one. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> Thank you so much for watching this video.

<time_token_5> <time_token_6> I would make myself a bowl of ramen. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> You know, I would finish the whole bowl, including the really salty soup. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> And the next morning when I wake up, my whole face is really swollen. <time_token_8> <time_token_8> It's kinda like today. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> So we're going to go in to Ride Ride Cat and we're going to make a really perfect bowl of noodle. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> Hopefully you don't eat them in a minute. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> Alright, let's start to make the shoyote. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> A quarter cup of soy sauce. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> Second is about two tablespoons. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> Rice wine about also two tablespoons. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Half tablespoon of brown ginger. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Also about half a spoon of ground garlic. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> We can buy this in any Japanese supermarket. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Couple of pieces of seaweed. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> Throw it all in. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> After 10 minutes of oiling the sauce, this is how it looks like. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Poor belly, you have to cut out the skin. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> And then you roll it. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> So do we put this in the pan? <time_token_28> <time_token_30> This is about like a 6 tablespoons of oil. <time_token_32> <time_token_35> And then you put it in my tissue and all the juice of the poor belly inside. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> So we're in this bowl. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> One hour I feel like it's quite fast. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> One, two chicken bones. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> One sheet of the combed seaweed. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Some pieces of the dried bonito fish. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> One tablespoon of dried shrimp. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> And sliced ginger. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> And chicken feet. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Two tablespoons of water. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> So basically this is ramen noodle and you can get it in the supermarket. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> You do a little bit of massage just to make them wake up. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> This is what you do with the meat. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> You do it with noodles. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> You do it with everything. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> It's kind of fun to do it. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> The last time we're going to talk about massaging chicken. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> This is what you do with massaging noodles. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> And let's cook them. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> We just drop it in here. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> And that's like super easy. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> It's cooking for about 2 minutes. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> This is like the biggest chopstick I have ever seen. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> This is like so cool. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> I need you to stop. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> It's going to add the broth into your bowl. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> With 3 tablespoons of the soy sauce. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> The soy tare that we did earlier. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> We've got hot water. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> And we're adding it into the bowl. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Just making it nice and neat. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> How many pieces?

<time_token_9> <time_token_9> Cut them up into julienne. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> The great thing about hot and sour soup <time_token_10> <time_token_11> is it seems like a really complex soup, <time_token_11> <time_token_11> but it's actually very simple to make. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> The main flavoring ingredients are white peppers, <time_token_12> <time_token_13> so make sure you have white pepper, and shiitake mushrooms. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> And here's where the real flavor comes in. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> One ounce of shiitake mushrooms. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> These were dry. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> These were previously dry. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> They look like this when they're dry. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> You soak one ounce of those <time_token_17> <time_token_17> in one and a half cups of boiling water, <time_token_17> <time_token_18> and what you get are these rehydrated, <time_token_18> <time_token_18> almost like new mushrooms. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> Squeeze out the liquid, but save the liquid <time_token_19> <time_token_20> because that's gonna add flavor to your soup. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> And slice these up, too. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> These get sliced about a quarter inch thick. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> These have such great texture, too. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> They're nice and chewy. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> And lastly, about seven ounces of firm tofu. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Just cut it into half inch cubes, nice cute little cubes. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> Cute, cute is so important <time_token_25> <time_token_26> when you're making hot and sour soup, don't you agree?

<time_token_43> <time_token_43> Once it comes to a simmer, <time_token_43> <time_token_44> you can add the rest of your ingredients. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> The scallion's saving about four tablespoons <time_token_44> <time_token_45> of the green part for garnish. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> The bamboo shoots and the tofu. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Then you just need to let everything simmer together. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> Basically you're just heating everything through. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> This needs to simmer for five minutes. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> I'm gonna get my thickener ready. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> A cornstarch slurry. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> I don't know if we've ever used a cornstarch slurry before, <time_token_51> <time_token_51> I feel like this might be the first time. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> It's a combination of water and cornstarch <time_token_52> <time_token_52> that you mix together. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Four tablespoons of cold water <time_token_53> <time_token_54> and two tablespoons of cornstarch. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> What you're gonna do is whisk your cornstarch <time_token_55> <time_token_55> into cold water. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> Make sure the water's cold. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> If it's boiling water, the cornstarch will lump up <time_token_56> <time_token_57> immediately, basically activate the thickening, <time_token_57> <time_token_58> and then it won't thicken anything. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> You'll just have a bunch of lumps. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> So make sure you're using cold water. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> Or it could be chicken stock. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> Cold chicken stock works fine too. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Whisk it and the cornstarch will dissolve right away. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Whisk the slurry into the hot soup as it's simmering. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> Make sure that you're whisking the whole time. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Make sure you continue whisking. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> If you just pour it in there, it'll also lump up. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Kind of like what I was saying before <time_token_64> <time_token_65> about adding the cornstarch to hot liquid. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> You can see that it's completely thickening already. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Just bring it back to a boil for the cornstarch <time_token_66> <time_token_67> to completely activate. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Now you're really, really close to done. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> The last thing that goes, well there are two last things. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Vinegar to make it sour and egg to make those strands <time_token_70> <time_token_70> that you always see in soup. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> So I'm gonna get the egg ready. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> We are ready people. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> As you can see, my cornstarch is completely activated <time_token_72> <time_token_73> because the liquid is at a boil. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Make sure that you bring it to a boil. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> Otherwise it might taste starchy. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Follow my lead. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Now you season it. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Let's see, does it need salt? <time_token_75> <time_token_75> It may not need salt, but it may. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> Maybe a tiny bit. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> And then vinegar, three tablespoons of white vinegar. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> I'm gonna start with two tablespoons and then add the third. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I like to see if it needs it. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> It doesn't always need it. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> Let's give it a taste. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Maybe a half tablespoon more. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> I'm gonna go for the whole thing. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Do it to your taste. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> So start your stirring and then pour in your egg <time_token_84> <time_token_84> and that should make nice long strands in the soup. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> Don't over stir it. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Otherwise it turns into scrambled eggs. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> And you're done. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> Wasn't that easy? <time_token_86> <time_token_87> You can sprinkle with the rest of your scallion greens <time_token_87> <time_token_88> I can't wait. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> I'm gonna have a bowl right now. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> If only you were here and you think <time_token_89> <time_token_89> you were in a Chinese restaurant. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Really easy, no special ingredients. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Tons of authentic flavor and super fast. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> It's spicy, it's sour. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> It's hot and sour soup made at home. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> Easier than takeout. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Make it tonight. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> I demand it.

<time_token_0> <time_token_1> to show you guys something quite special. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> I hope you guys enjoy it and let's get straight into it. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> So for this recipe what you're going to do is you're going to make smooth cuts of salmon <time_token_4> <time_token_4> You want them to be more or less five fingers long. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> Just cut the pieces of fish at the required length, about so. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> So five fingers for me is about ten centimeters, which is 2.5 inches. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> There we go. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> And now basically you just want to create some nice smooth long pieces of sashimi. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> There we go, beautiful. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> So just drag your knife through it. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> If your knife isn't sharp enough to do it then you can sharpen it or you can buy one <time_token_12> <time_token_12> of these amazing knives. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> You can check out my store link is just here on the top left corner. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> And there you can see everything about sharpening the knife and also buying one of these. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> So just a couple of cuts we need of each, some of salmon and then some of tuna. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Now here the piece of tuna is extruding a little bit, so what I'm going to do is just <time_token_17> <time_token_17> do one little cut just to make it all even. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> And this can be used for the tartare later, don't worry about it, nothing goes to waste <time_token_20> <time_token_21> And you just want it to be reasonably thin, not too thin, because they are going to go <time_token_21> <time_token_21> around like a roll. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> Okay, beautiful, there we go. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> All right, so you simply take a little piece of rice, you want it to be quite small because <time_token_25> <time_token_26> you don't want it to go over the top, like so. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Okay, then you take a slice of avocado, put it around, take in care to put the green line <time_token_28> <time_token_29> This gives it a nice aesthetic look when it's finished. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Now you wrap it in your fish, this one is salmon. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Now add a very thin strip of nori seaweed paper just to keep it all together. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Okay, now make the tuna one. <time_token_35> <time_token_37> Again a very small bowl of rice, not too big, then add your strip of avocado, very thinly <time_token_37> <time_token_39> sliced, just round with the dark green pot on top, and then add your piece of fish. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> This one is going to be tuna. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> Just wrap it around lightly, perfect, and just press the rice a little bit deeper, good. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> And now to keep it all together, a very thin strip of nori seaweed paper, make it thin, <time_token_44> <time_token_45> don't make it too big, and just wrap it around. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> I find the thinner they are the more pretty they look. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> Now set to one side and make the tartare. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Now to make some salmon and tuna tartare, all you need is a little off-cut of tuna and <time_token_48> <time_token_49> the salmon that you had before, and just simply chop it extremely fine. <time_token_51> <time_token_54> Just like so, there we go, once you've done the main chop just turn it around and then <time_token_54> <time_token_57> just do another rough chop, that's the tuna, wipe your knife off, and then the salmon. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> So just chop it up into nice fine little tartare, there we go, beautiful. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Once you've chopped it up transfer it over to some bowls, just like so. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Add a little bit of sriracha sauce, I prefer this make, I've tried a lot of other ones <time_token_62> <time_token_64> and this one is the best, just a tiny little bit of that, a very small dash of soy sauce, <time_token_64> <time_token_65> add a squirt of lime juice just to give it a little kick. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> Then some chopped chives, alright perfect. <time_token_68> <time_token_71> Now just mix, beautiful. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Now just squish the rice a little bit deeper if it's coming out too far, you want to be <time_token_72> <time_token_73> able to really keep this stuff. <time_token_73> <time_token_78> With the tuna one I'm going to put the salmon, just like so, there we go, okay, beautiful. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> And then with the salmon one I'm going to put the tuna on top, just gives it a beautiful <time_token_79> <time_token_80> contrast of colors, like to mix it up. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Okay so just add some of the spicy tuna tartare, beautiful. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> And then you just finish it off with a little bit of chopped chives on top, there we go. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Very little goes a long way with this. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> I hope you guys enjoyed this, these are delicious and they are ready to eat like this, if you <time_token_87> <time_token_88> want you can dip them in a little bit of soy sauce with wasabi, but I mean they are already <time_token_88> <time_token_89> seasoned and they have a little bit of spice to it so you can just eat them like so. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Thank you for watching another one of my

On this episode of Laura in the Kitchen, I'm going to show <time_token_2> <time_token_3> you how to make the perfect hummus. It's going to be creamy, it's going to be full of flavor <time_token_3> <time_token_6> with garlic and parsley and tahini. It is going to be perfect. It's great for any occasion, <time_token_6> <time_token_8> any cocktail party. The Super Bowl is right around the corner. It's the perfect thing <time_token_8> <time_token_10> that you can serve with either peanut chips, some cucumbers, some carrots, some baguette, <time_token_10> <time_token_11> you name it, it's perfect. So let's do it! <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Okay, so first thing we're going to do is go over the ingredients, and the ingredients <time_token_18> <time_token_20> are super simple and easy. You're going to need some chickpeas, these are just canned <time_token_20> <time_token_23> chickpeas drained and rinsed. You're going to need some lemon, parsley, some fresh garlic, <time_token_23> <time_token_25> some tahini paste, salt, pepper and olive oil, extra virgin olive oil. Now I'm going <time_token_25> <time_token_26> to do this in a food processor so it's going to be liquid split, super simple and easy. <time_token_26> <time_token_30> I'm going to put my chickpeas in here, along with my garlic and parsley, squeeze of lemon, <time_token_30> <time_token_33> well a whole lemon, a nice amount of zing, so it's not sort of overpowering, creamy and <time_token_33> <time_token_36> rich. The lemon really adds a really good freshness and bright note to this. Just squeeze <time_token_36> <time_token_39> the whole thing in there, and just a little bit of tahini paste. Now tahini paste is a <time_token_39> <time_token_41> paste made out of sesame seeds and it's very traditional in hummus, so we have to put that <time_token_41> <time_token_44> in there. You can find it at any supermarket, but if you can't find it or you don't want <time_token_44> <time_token_45> to put it in there, just leave it out. It's still going to be a fantastic dip either way. <time_token_45> <time_token_48> But the tahini is just like one of the, well it's one of the main ingredients in traditional <time_token_48> <time_token_51> hummus, so I'm putting some in. Some salt and pepper, and I'm not going to put any olive <time_token_51> <time_token_54> oil yet. I'm going to pulse this and get it nice and sort of chunky, and then we're <time_token_54> <time_token_56> going to drizzle in the olive oil through the feeding tube. The consistency is looking <time_token_56> <time_token_59> pretty good, nice and chunky. I'm just going to put the lid back on, and now I'm going <time_token_59> <time_token_64> to start drizzling in the olive oil. That looks fantastic. The texture is wonderful. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> If you want it a bit more chunky, by all means, leave it a bit more chunky. I like <time_token_66> <time_token_68> it nice and smooth like that. You can serve this with pita chips, you can serve this with <time_token_68> <time_token_71> a nice crudit\u00e9s platter, you know, some baby carrots and some, I don't know, celery or <time_token_71> <time_token_73> red bell peppers is one of my favorite ways to eat this, but my absolute favorite way <time_token_73> <time_token_75> is with cucumbers. There's just something about the fresh, crisp cucumber with the rich <time_token_75> <time_token_78> creamy texture of the hummus. I just love it. Now, traditionally, I mean, you would <time_token_78> <time_token_79> want to let this sit in your fridge just for a couple of hours, just for the flavors to <time_token_79> <time_token_84> develop, and it will taste much better, but this is so good. Mmm, mmm, wonderful. Well, <time_token_84> <time_token_87> it's easy, it's quick, it's inexpensive, and it's perfect for any party. I hope you enjoyed <time_token_87> <time_token_89> spending time with me. To get this recipe and others, go to www.laurenandkristin.com, <time_token_89> <time_token_90> and I'll see you next time.

Of course, I'm talking about KFC's Fried Chicken. <time_token_13> <time_token_15> So the first thing that we're going to do to get started on our fried chicken is just into a bowl. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> I've got some plain flour and we're going to season our flour. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> First, I'm going to be adding in some salt and some pepper. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> Also, I'm going to be adding in some garlic powder. <time_token_19> <time_token_22> Next is some onion powder and lastly, some paprika. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> And just give that a good mix around with the flour. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> So that's what you'll end up with. A beautiful flour spice mix. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> So we'll just put this to one side. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> So just into a separate bowl, I'm going to be putting in one egg. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> And I'm also going to add in some milk as well. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> And just mix the egg and the milk together. Just give it a whisk. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Now of course, you're going to need some chicken. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> Now the chicken that I've got is some drumsticks and some wings. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> If you wanted to do the chicken breast or the chicken tenderloin, you can as well. <time_token_35> <time_token_37> But just make sure the skin is on because that's how we're going to get that really crispy skin on the outside. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> So what I want you to do, really simple, is I want you to put the chicken straight into the egg wash. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Make sure you get everything coated. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> And then I'm going to be putting it straight into the flour. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> And again, make sure you get this really coated well. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> Now just shake off the excess flour and I'm going to double dip back into the egg and then back into the flour. <time_token_45> <time_token_47> And what that will do is give us a really crunchy coating on the outside. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> And just keep repeating that process for all the chicken that you have. <time_token_48> <time_token_51> So once we've finished coating our chicken in the egg wash and the flour, we're going to deep fry them. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Now I've just got some vegetable oil in a large pan. <time_token_52> <time_token_54> And I've just put a bit of flour in the egg wash just in there to see if it's ready to fry. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> And if you do that and it sizzles and rises to the top, then you know it's hot enough. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> So we've got our chicken here, all nicely coated. <time_token_56> <time_token_59> And I'm just going to pop it in really carefully, also with one of our wings as well. <time_token_60> <time_token_63> So guys, we want to cook this for about 12 to 15 minutes depending on the size of the chicken. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> But what we want essentially on the outside is a nice dark crispy skin with that batter. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> So guys, it's been about 10 minutes. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> You can just see here, that's the colour that you're after, that beautiful golden brown colour. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> So what I want you to do now is just turn the heat off, drain them on some paper towel, <time_token_70> <time_token_71> and then we can get stuck into these bad boys. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> So there you have it guys. <time_token_72> <time_token_75> It is so easy to make the smell as un-oval and just looking at that crispy skin on the outside. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Now just check that out now. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> I'm just going to show you something just here on the skin. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I'm just going to pull this back just so you can see there. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> We've got this beautiful moist chicken there and this crispy skin. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Oh, it's hot too. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> Just check out that moist chicken in there. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> That skin is just peeling back. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> Wow, that is yum-o. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> So give this one a go. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> It is so easy to do. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> It's cheap to do and you'll have heaps of fun making it as well. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> You guys take care. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> I will see you this Monday for budget meals. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> So until then, take care.

<time_token_9> <time_token_10> There's a few things that make an amazing burger. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> You've got to start with really good beef. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> So we have the beef chuck here, which is part of the cow shoulder. <time_token_12> <time_token_12> It has a lot of fat content. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> It's a little bit tougher. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> There's a good chew on it. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> So that's why you grind it. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> So I'm just going to cut this up in little strips. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> It's just better to grind your own meat because you're in total control. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> You grind it. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> It's the freshest. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> It's not no frills down on King Street and Parkdale, gypsy meat. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> You don't trim off any of this fat. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Keep it in there. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> The ratio will work itself out. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> I always find. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> You don't have a meat grinder, go to a butcher shop and get them to grind your beef fresh. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> The main thing that people always do is fuck with the patties. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> They put garlic in it, Worcestershire, parsley, crap, eggs, breadcrumbs. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> All you have to use is good beef and treat it like a steak, but don't fuck with the shit. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> Just make a beef patty and that's all you need. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> We have our ground beef here. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> So now we just have to make the patties. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> You want to make it into a fat patty so it's nice and juicy. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> You just kind of like use your one hand patting it up and then you're patting it down and <time_token_26> <time_token_27> then you're patting it around. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> You got a pretty good fucking patty, right? <time_token_28> <time_token_29> Maybe we'll start with four. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> Four burgers, a family of four. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> See a lot of people cook them on grills. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> I prefer to cook them in like cast iron pans like a griddle because I find when people <time_token_31> <time_token_32> are cooking burgers on grills, they either fall apart and that's why people always add <time_token_32> <time_token_32> crap to it to keep them together. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> What we want to do is sear these. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> See all this fat? <time_token_33> <time_token_33> These are all going to melt away. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> So that's going to create these little cavernous, crispy, fat fucking chunk pieces and then <time_token_35> <time_token_35> you're going to have a perfect fucking burger. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> So when you cook burgers, medium high heat in a cast iron pan is your best bet. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> So you want to make sure that it's not too hot because you're going to burn it. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> Burnt beef tastes like shit. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> So you're going to just treat it like a steak, right? <time_token_38> <time_token_38> I've already said that. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> So we got the pepper heavily seasoned with salt because it's a fat piece of meat. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Flip it over and do the same thing. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Because of the fat in here, you actually don't really have to put fat in the pan. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> About a six ounce burger is the burgers that we made today. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> You want to cook those about three and a half to four minutes aside for a nice medium, medium <time_token_44> <time_token_45> So now we're just going to let these guys cook and render. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> I think the best technique for burger toppings is not to make these big fat things that are <time_token_46> <time_token_47> going to slide everywhere. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> I like to make a lot of thin slices so that when you crunch through it, it's like a thousand <time_token_48> <time_token_48> And so you don't get these like big slide around tomatoes. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> All these guys out in the world when you're cutting these fucking onions and you're crying <time_token_49> <time_token_50> is because you have a dull knife. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> A dull knife means you're a fucking loser. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> You don't cry if you're cutting onions with a sharp knife. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Any good sandwich worth its weight has pickles in it. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> If a sandwich doesn't have pickles in it, it's probably going to be garbage. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Throw it on the floor, walk away. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Then we need iceberg lettuce shaved up. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> I got some pepperoncinis. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> I like taking a bite of the burger, take a bite of the pepperoncini, a little spice, <time_token_56> <time_token_56> a little heat. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> And that's all you need for toppings. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> What we're looking for when we're cooking the burgers is that the sides are going to <time_token_58> <time_token_58> start turning brown. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> You know like when you're cooking pancakes around the edges, you know when to cook the <time_token_59> <time_token_59> pancakes, you get the little bubbles around the side. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> That bubble is the browning of the side of the beef. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> That means that it's golden brown underneath and it's starting to cook. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> That's exactly what I'm looking for. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> See all those little crevices? <time_token_62> <time_token_62> That's the fat rendering out. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Staying juicy in the middle, super fucking crunchy on the top. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> The other component is obviously really good fucking buns. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> Right here is a beautiful egg bun. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> See that yellow color? <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Egg bun, it just seems a little bit lighter than the Wonder Bread, the smoosh. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> I need to toast up some buns. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Always got to be buttering the buns, because if you ain't got butter buns, they're not <time_token_68> <time_token_68> going to be good. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> So these burgers are almost done. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> This is a huge brick of American cheese. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Cheese makes it creamy and fucking yummy. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> This is the real deal. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> This isn't Kraft's single cheese. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> It could look like a Star David, the land of milk and honey. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> All the best things in the world are simple, right? <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Like a hot babe on the beach. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> She's got her hair. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> She's kind of naked. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> This is the same way. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> You don't want your shit all messed up. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> This is the bikini. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> This is the sand. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> This is the tequila you're drinking. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> This is the fucking babe right here. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Think of a cheeseburger as a babe. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> You don't want to fuck with a babe too much, right? <time_token_78> <time_token_79> So we're going to steam the burgers, because we want the cheese to melt a little more. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> So we're going to just add a little bit of water, put a bowl on top or a plate. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> Just steam for a little bit. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> You don't want to cook them too much. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> They're done cooking. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> See that steam? <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Hey, world, cheesy burgers. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> What you know about it? <time_token_82> <time_token_83> I'm going to dress these guys up. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> So we've got the lettuce on the bottom, we've got the patty, we've got some onion, we've <time_token_85> <time_token_88> got some tomato, some pickle, we've got some mustard, and we've got the ketchup, and some <time_token_88> <time_token_89> These are the best cheeseburgers you'll ever have. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> This is a perfect cheeseburger right here. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> These two fools are about to eat the best burger of their lives. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> They're extremely lucky today. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> We are too lucky. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> It's a big boy burger. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> No baby dick burgers over here. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> Sometimes you don't have to eat a burger. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Don't eat a burger while you're in church. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Don't eat a burger when you're getting a blowjob. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> That's how you make a fucking burger. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> Eat some fucking burgers, world. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> They're good for you. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> Look at me. <time_token_98> <time_token_98> That is a good burger.

In this recipe, <time_token_2> <time_token_4> easy way to cook those bratwurst. Of course, you could have bought these at the supermarket, <time_token_4> <time_token_5> but why not make them fresh? If I can do it, you can do it for sure. I have one pound of <time_token_5> <time_token_6> homemade bratwurst here and I have a dish here <time_token_8> <time_token_9> going to add my bratwurst. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> click on the <time_token_12> <time_token_13> my one pound of sausages in the roasting pan. <time_token_15> <time_token_18> and then about a teaspoon of salt, sea salt of course. To this, I have one small yellow <time_token_19> <time_token_21> up to a boil and let these sausages boil for about five minutes. The mixture of the beer <time_token_21> <time_token_22> and the onions is just coming up to a boil. Grab a pair of tongs. You want to keep rotating <time_token_22> <time_token_24> these sausages just to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of your pan. Let these boil <time_token_24> <time_token_25> like I said about five minutes. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> essentially at this point and <time_token_27> <time_token_29> these on the grill. If you were to put raw sausages on a grill, they would scorch and <time_token_29> <time_token_30> burn on the outside before the inside is completely done. If <time_token_30> <time_token_33> internal thermometer and test for 165 degrees on all of this ground sausage product. Today, <time_token_34> <time_token_35> have a grill, live in an apartment, or just want to do it inside on a cold and rainy day. <time_token_35> <time_token_37> In a large bowl here, I have ten cloves of really large garlic right inside of that. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> I have one large red onion sliced. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> going to throw in about a teaspoon of salt and grab some thyme. We probably want ten <time_token_42> <time_token_44> sprigs of thyme just thrown in there just like so. I have four potatoes cut into about <time_token_44> <time_token_45> half inch pieces. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> of pepper to this. I get a lot of questions about this little spice grinder. Check with <time_token_50> <time_token_52> three tablespoons of olive oil. Now that <time_token_53> <time_token_54> is just going to give me room to get everything well coated with the oil and the salt and pepper. <time_token_56> <time_token_59> to discard the beer. Get everything in your bowl. Pause it well in the olive oil, salt <time_token_59> <time_token_60> and pepper and all that good stuff. Mix it all together. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> cast iron dish that I was boiling the sausages in. This could be even a sheet pan, a roasting <time_token_62> <time_token_63> pan, a casserole dish, whatever you have. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> to 375 degrees. If you have a roast function on your oven, <time_token_65> <time_token_68> just turns on the top element occasionally. Toss all this right into your big dish. As <time_token_68> <time_token_69> you can see, this recipe would multiply up really, really easily. It can be altered. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> that is. All into our roasting pan here. <time_token_73> <time_token_76> so we get a nice caramel color all over the top. There we go. Our roasted bratwurst right <time_token_76> <time_token_77> out of the oven with delicious caramelized onions and garlic all mixed in there, as <time_token_77> <time_token_79> well as these potatoes. The starch of that really soaks up so much of this great flavor. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> on it so they all fell off and flavored our dish. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> and get all that out. Then call folks to the table because this is ready to serve. Of course <time_token_84> <time_token_85> you could put this out on a large platter and bring it to the table or have folks come <time_token_85> <time_token_86> right to the kitchen and pull it right out of the roasting pan. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> really nice and easy even for weeknight dinners.

Welcome to cesraicaskitchen.com. Today I am making masala dosa. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> Plain dosa and masala dosa I am making today. <time_token_4> <time_token_7> For masala dosa we normally take 1 cup of urad dal and 2 cups of rice or either 3 cups of rice like that. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> But in my recipe for 1 cup of urad dal I only take 1 cup of whole grain brown rice. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> That way we don't get too much carbohydrate. We get enough protein. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> This is urad dal and also I have 1 tablespoon of fenugreek seeds. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> Fenugreek seeds are high in vitamins and minerals. <time_token_13> <time_token_15> So whenever you make it clear dosa use fenugreek seeds also. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> So they will be mixed with batter and it is a good way to consume. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> I am going to mix everything. I am going to take all these in a container. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> I will go ahead and wash a couple of times and then soak in water for about 4 to 5 hours. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> I rinsed them twice and soaked in water. So I am going to leave it for 4 or 5 hours to soak. <time_token_22> <time_token_24> And then I will put it in my blender and make a smooth batter for dosa. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> Ok here is my batter. I left it overnight for fermentation. Now it is ready to make dosa. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> And here I have my masala curry, potato, chana and green peas masala curry. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> Because breakfast is the most important meal of the day. So we need to make it nutritious. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> So I made with potato, green peas and chickpeas. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Let's make the masala dosa. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> Here I have taken a cast iron pan. I don't use non-stick pans in my house. So I only use cast iron pans. <time_token_34> <time_token_37> Put it on a medium flame. Now it is hot. So I took few drops of oil on the paper napkin and carefully it is hot. <time_token_37> <time_token_40> So just rubbing on the pan so that it gets a thin layer of oil. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> Ok now I am going to make my plain dosa first. Take one layer and spread it. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> You can spread it as big as you can. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Just put some oil on it. <time_token_48> <time_token_52> Now you can see it is getting red. So I am going to take it out. <time_token_52> <time_token_56> So we don't have to flip it. If you flip it, it will get soft. So if you want to crispy dosa, don't flip it. Just like this. <time_token_56> <time_token_61> This is the plain dosa. It is nice and crispy. So now let us make masala dosa. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> It already has some oil in here. Just spread it again so that it gets evenly on the pan. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> We don't want drops of oil on the pan. Thin layer of oil that's all. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Now I am taking another one. Take one layer of batter and put it in the center. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> And spread it. You can make it as big as you can. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> You don't need a non-stick pan actually. It comes out just fine. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> You can put some oil around the edges and in the middle. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> We started changing the color. I am going to put the curry. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> You can watch my curry. I already made a video on this. You can watch the recipe. <time_token_78> <time_token_80> Put some ghee on the top of the curry. It is very nice taste. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> You can put it on dosa also. Just a few drops will be enough. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> And if you want you can put some butter also. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> It is all cooked and you can see the nice crispy color.

counting numbers and calories <time_token_4> <time_token_4> in your food. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> It's very much about enjoying the eating experience. <time_token_6> <time_token_8> And there's not much I enjoy more than eating wings on Super Bowl Sunday. <time_token_8> <time_token_10> I'm Danny Spies and for this quick bite I'm showing you how to make my clean and delicious <time_token_10> <time_token_11> Baked Buffalo Wings. <time_token_11> <time_token_13> Now the first thing I did was set up a rimmed baking sheet by covering it with aluminum <time_token_13> <time_token_14> foil and then topping it with a wired rack. <time_token_14> <time_token_17> The aluminum foil just makes for easy clean up and the wired rack allows the heat to circulate <time_token_17> <time_token_18> around the wings while they're cooking so that they don't get soggy. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> Then to prepare the wings I gave them a good rinse under some cold water. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Then I patted them nice and dry with some paper towels. <time_token_21> <time_token_24> And then using a nice sharp knife I separated the wing and the drummette right at the joint <time_token_24> <time_token_24> where they attach. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> Since we're baking our wings instead of frying them I like to make sure that I infuse lots <time_token_26> <time_token_27> of flavors into the wings themselves. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> And here's how I do that. <time_token_28> <time_token_31> I start by adding in a tablespoon each of garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, great <time_token_31> <time_token_34> color there, a half a teaspoon of kosher salt and a half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> Now you could add more or less cayenne pepper depending on how spicy you like your wings. <time_token_36> <time_token_38> And then a quarter cup of your favorite buffalo wing sauce right over the top. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> Then you just got to get your hands in there and mix it really well. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> You just want to be sure that all those wings are coated with the sauce and the spices. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> Now you could marinate these anywhere from 30 minutes up to several hours but since my <time_token_45> <time_token_47> babysitter is going to be back very soon with my kids I need to wash my hands and get these <time_token_47> <time_token_47> in the oven. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> And just remember whenever the raw chicken touches you really want to make sure you give <time_token_49> <time_token_49> it a really good wash. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Hands sink, cutting board, scrub it all down. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> Now I've got my oven preheating at 400 degrees and I'm just going to get my wings onto the <time_token_53> <time_token_54> sheet that I set up earlier. <time_token_54> <time_token_56> Now you can get them on the rack here nice and close and cozy but you do want to avoid <time_token_56> <time_token_57> having them actually touch because then they may start to get soggy. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Nobody wants a soggy wing. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> So now we're going to put these in the oven for 20 minutes. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> Then I'm going to take them out, give them all a flip and then pop them back in and finish <time_token_61> <time_token_62> them off for another 20. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> At the end of the day eating well is really all about balance and that doesn't mean that <time_token_64> <time_token_66> we need to balance every single meal that we eat. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> For instance, Super Bowl Sunday. <time_token_66> <time_token_69> I have full intention of enjoying some wings and a nice cold beer and all that means is <time_token_69> <time_token_71> come Monday I'm going to have plenty of water and make sure that I have extra veggies. <time_token_71> <time_token_73> See the goal here is not to be crazy, it's to eat well, feel good and have some fun. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Our wings are done. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> I'm going to pull them out. <time_token_74> <time_token_77> And as you can see they are nice and golden brown and they smell amazing. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> Now you're going to notice that baked wings don't get quite as crispy as fried wings but <time_token_79> <time_token_80> I promise you these guys are packed with flavor. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> Once the wings are cool enough to handle you're just going to get them into a nice big bowl <time_token_82> <time_token_83> and toss them with another half cup of buffalo sauce. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> Now I like to stick to the classics and serve my wings up with carrot and celery sticks <time_token_86> <time_token_87> and of course a little bit of blue cheese dressing. <time_token_87> <time_token_90> For more simple and

<time_token_2> <time_token_2> you how to make a romantic dinner for two for your special Valentine. <time_token_2> <time_token_4> And right now we're going to work on the escargot, our appetizer for today. <time_token_4> <time_token_4> And this is what you're going to need in order to do it. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> We're going to need some nice dishes for baking escargot if you have them. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> If not, you can take a Pyrex dish, just anything that's oven safe, and you can put it in the <time_token_7> <time_token_7> oven that way. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> We're going to need some garlic, some chopped fresh chives, some cleaned and rinsed escargot, <time_token_9> <time_token_10> I like to use white pepper for this, some cooking sherry. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> We'll need some butter, softened already, a bowl, a fork, and a garlic press. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> So let's get started on our escargot appetizer. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> Okay, so make sure that you thoroughly rinse off your escargot under cool water. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Use a colander, or you could use a bowl, but you could see there's, you know, if not that <time_token_15> <time_token_17> this is bad, put those little parts in there, just gently rinsing. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> You could run them under. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> If there's anything that's hanging on, just pull it off nice. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> And then we're going to go ahead and pat them dry. <time_token_20> <time_token_23> And we're going to use six, six for me and six for you, for your romantic date for Valentine's <time_token_23> <time_token_24> And remember, always wash your hands. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Okay, we've already got it softened. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> So I like to use a fork just to mix it up, get it nice and mushy. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Okay, and we're going to take, you know, probably two or three cloves of garlic, can't have <time_token_29> <time_token_30> And we're pressing it so that all we're really getting out of this is really the garlic <time_token_30> <time_token_32> The skin we can toss aside, okay, press another one. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> You could chop this if you want, but I love using the garlic press, it's so simple, it's <time_token_33> <time_token_34> so easy, and I like the results that I get out of it. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> So I'm going to probably do, I mean, we're only doing 12 escargot today, six for me, six <time_token_35> <time_token_36> And so I'm going to use about three cloves of garlic, I guess. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> Okay, that's done. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Just some chives, I guess maybe a tablespoon or tablespoon and a half. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> I like to use white pepper, I don't know, because it doesn't show up as much. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> It is a little bit stronger, so you have to go a little easier on it than you would <time_token_43> <time_token_44> And then cooking sherry, you can get this at the grocery store, you don't have to buy <time_token_44> <time_token_44> an expensive sherry, just any kind of cooking sherry. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> And I'm going to slowly put that in until I figure after I get the right consistency, <time_token_46> <time_token_47> and I might have to add more, but for the meantime, I'm just going to add just a little <time_token_47> <time_token_48> bit and just marry all of those ingredients together, and you can smell it already, it <time_token_49> <time_token_50> You can use this as a basis for so many other different things. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> You could use this as a butter on filets, today we're not going to do that. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> You could use this on fish, you could use it on chicken, just about anything, it's just <time_token_52> <time_token_53> a wonderful base to make your foods taste so well. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> Okay, mix that all up together. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Now in our handy dandy little escargot dishes here, I'm going to go ahead and I'm just going <time_token_56> <time_token_58> to put a little dollop, let's do it this way, just a little dollop at the bottom of each <time_token_58> <time_token_59> one of these, just so that when we put the escargot in, it doesn't burn or it has a nice <time_token_59> <time_token_60> little base on the bottom. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> Now as it cooks, it's going to totally submerge the little escargot, which is exactly what <time_token_62> <time_token_62> we want to do. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> Alright, that's mine. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Now of course if you have extra of this, it's not a problem, I'd rather have more than less, <time_token_64> <time_token_65> you don't have to go back and do all the steps again. <time_token_65> <time_token_67> Alright, and this is a very, very simple appetizer, but it's sure to please your Valentine. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> Okay, alright, now we're just going to simply take an escargot, pop it in there. <time_token_69> <time_token_71> The nice thing about these dishes is that there's room to have it, the butter when it <time_token_71> <time_token_72> melts to cover it up, and you see there's a little rim here, it makes it nice, just <time_token_72> <time_token_74> pop each one of those in, hopefully I counted right, perfect. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> Okay, now we're going to take the rest of our butter and just put it on top, and I tell <time_token_76> <time_token_77> you this is so good, especially after you've eaten all your escargot, then you want to <time_token_77> <time_token_79> take some nice bread and dip it in this juice, it's so good. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> Now I've already got my oven preheated at 350, and it really does not take very long <time_token_80> <time_token_81> to cook this. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> 15, 18 minutes or until it's bubbling, because the escargot is already cooked. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> So you're just going to get it basically good and hot, and it's usually only 15 or <time_token_84> <time_token_86> Okay, I like to put it on a cookie sheet, in case it does happen to overflow, it's got <time_token_86> <time_token_86> lined with tin foil and it won't make your oven all messy. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Okay, so let's go on over to the oven. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> Okay, so here we have our escargot, it's been in the oven for 15 minutes at 350, and as <time_token_91> <time_token_92> you'll see, you know when it's ready because it's nice and bubbly and hot, and it is gorgeous. <time_token_92> <time_token_94> Look at that, and it just smells so amazing, I wish you could smell it. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> And this is a wonderful way to start off your romantic Valentine's dinner. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> And next, we're going to make our borson scallop potatoes. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> To

welcome you all to your cooking <time_token_1> <time_token_1> channel let's speak foodie today I will show you how to make a very famous <time_token_1> <time_token_3> Indian appetizer I know the first thing that comes to anyone mind is samosa so <time_token_3> <time_token_3> let's go through the ingredients first <time_token_5> <time_token_6> let's start preparing our dough first in a mixing tray add one and a half cup of <time_token_6> <time_token_7> all-purpose flour 2 tbsp of clarified butter which is ghee <time_token_8> <time_token_8> salt to taste <time_token_9> <time_token_11> now mix flour and ghee add pinch of nigella seeds some carom seeds <time_token_12> <time_token_16> 1 tbsp of oil I'm using olive oil you can use any oil mix it like this it <time_token_16> <time_token_18> will help in mixing all the grains of flour with oil and ghee and this is the <time_token_18> <time_token_19> trick to make a perfect crust of samosa add little bit of water at the time keep <time_token_19> <time_token_22> mixing add some more water mix it kneading will take about seven to eight <time_token_22> <time_token_24> minutes now dough is done cover it with wet paper towel and keep it aside for 20 <time_token_24> <time_token_26> minutes let's start preparing the filling add 2 tbsp of clarified butter <time_token_26> <time_token_28> in a pan add cumin seeds coriander seeds <time_token_32> <time_token_35> throw in some green chilies after 30 seconds add chopped onion give it a quick stir keep <time_token_35> <time_token_39> stirring after a minute or so add turmeric powder just a pinch of mix it <time_token_41> <time_token_43> add garam masala add some chaat masala mix it all together nicely <time_token_45> <time_token_47> now I'll add some frozen peas saute keep stirring <time_token_49> <time_token_49> after one and a half minute add black salt <time_token_51> <time_token_52> throw in boiled and cubed potatoes give it a good mix <time_token_52> <time_token_54> turn off this stove and add chopped cilantro just give it a quick mix and filling is ready <time_token_54> <time_token_57> let's check our dough before I roll it I'll give a final knead <time_token_58> <time_token_59> divide it into three balls flatten it and roll it <time_token_61> <time_token_62> you can see I have not rolled it very thin so make sure it's not very thin <time_token_63> <time_token_66> start it with the help of knife apply water and make a cone seal it nicely <time_token_66> <time_token_68> this is a perfect cone now add your filling <time_token_72> <time_token_74> apply water on the edges just press it a bit so that filling doesn't come out give <time_token_74> <time_token_75> it a pinch and stretch it and joint all the edges like this <time_token_78> <time_token_80> seal it really fine this is how you have to do it now press it from the bottom so <time_token_80> <time_token_81> that your samosa is tanned this looks perfect cover the prepared samosas while you are making <time_token_81> <time_token_84> rest let's start frying heat your oil on low heat the temperature should not be very high <time_token_84> <time_token_88> at this point of time gently add your samosas fry it on low medium heat and after five minutes <time_token_88> <time_token_90> you can increase the temperature on the medium heat and keep frying it will take about 12 <time_token_90> <time_token_92> to 15 minutes to get the nice brown golden color the texture is perfect and crispy and <time_token_92> <time_token_94> it's ready to serve you can enjoy

episode of Cooking <time_token_2> <time_token_3> Well today we are going back to our Asian roots, well I don't have any Asian roots but <time_token_3> <time_token_3> I figured I'd just throw that in. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> You have probably seen or if you have not you got to check out the Junkyard cooking <time_token_4> <time_token_5> playlist where I made some sushi rolls, California rolls. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> Now again I am not a chef in any way when it comes to any of this stuff, I'm just a <time_token_7> <time_token_7> guy who loves to cook and loves to share it with you guys. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> But one thing I have been able to figure out is how to make some wonderful MLG spicy tuna <time_token_8> <time_token_9> So I figured I was going to go ahead and show you how to make those, well let's get started. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> Alright the ingredients are pretty basic, we have ourselves a nice piece of sushi tuna, <time_token_10> <time_token_12> we have some eggs, we also have some Japanese mayo and some Japanese or Asian style hot <time_token_12> <time_token_14> sauce, it's called sirera srirachi, hot sauce, chili sauce, some sesame seeds, we have ourselves <time_token_14> <time_token_16> some seaweed, go ahead and wrap it up in, as well as we have ourselves some sushi rice. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> First thing we want to go ahead and do is cut the tuna up, so pretty much we are just <time_token_17> <time_token_17> going to go ahead and slice this up, you want to slice it pretty much on the grains so it <time_token_17> <time_token_19> stays somewhat together but again with sushi rolls we are pretty much just chopping it <time_token_19> <time_token_19> up so it's alright. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> This was actually pre-frozen, flash frozen in the ocean is how they do it nowadays, as <time_token_21> <time_token_22> you can see we just got them in nice, we don't want them too big but we don't want them too <time_token_22> <time_token_24> small either so we are just going to go ahead and slice this up, alright, going to put it <time_token_24> <time_token_24> all in a bowl. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> Then on top of that we are going to go ahead and add the fish roe, fish eggs, good scoop <time_token_26> <time_token_28> of that, alright, then we are going to add some of the hot sauce to make that spicy, <time_token_28> <time_token_29> and remember this has a good bite to it so be ginger if you don't want to give it a lot. <time_token_29> <time_token_32> Then we are going to add our mayo, then we are just going to stir it all up, again the <time_token_32> <time_token_34> more hot sauce you add, the spicier it gets, oh look at that, beautiful, alright, next. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> The first couple of things we need to do is get ourselves, we have our clean cutting <time_token_35> <time_token_37> board here, we have our bamboo wrap, again this is something you can pick up at lots <time_token_37> <time_token_38> of grocery stores now but you can also pick this up at an Asian specialty restaurant or <time_token_38> <time_token_38> an Asian specialty market and such as that. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Now when you have your sushi wrap you actually have two different sides, you got a shiny <time_token_39> <time_token_40> side and a little bit duller side, the duller side is where you are going to go ahead and <time_token_40> <time_token_41> put your sticky rice or your AK sushi rice. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Now I also have some water right here, this is where you want to always go ahead and put <time_token_42> <time_token_43> your, you want to keep your hands moist, alright, and what we are going to do is I like to go <time_token_43> <time_token_44> ahead and rinse a little bit of the water off and you want to go ahead and then grab <time_token_44> <time_token_45> the sushi, a nice big, don't be shy, go ahead and grab a nice hunk of sushi, now you need <time_token_45> <time_token_46> to go ahead and make sure your hands stay moist otherwise your hands will stick to the <time_token_46> <time_token_48> rice thus not making it the, well the easiest thing to work with here, alright so what we <time_token_48> <time_token_49> are going to do is go ahead and lay the rice out, pretty much all over the whole piece <time_token_49> <time_token_51> of seaweed and one thing you can always add things to this if you want, I mean I am just <time_token_51> <time_token_52> going to go ahead and just put the tuna roll in there but you could add, if you want you <time_token_52> <time_token_53> could add avocados to it, cucumbers, all kinds of stuff but this first of all we are just <time_token_53> <time_token_54> going to go ahead and just add the tuna, so we got the rice right there, then we are adding <time_token_54> <time_token_56> the tuna on it next, just make a nice line right down the side there, add some of the <time_token_56> <time_token_58> sesame seed, alright, and then what we could do is you want to get it right to the edge <time_token_59> <time_token_60> of the bamboo sheet and then fold it over, just like that, see the way that folds over <time_token_60> <time_token_61> and then you got this, you want to try to make sure you don't put the bamboo part of <time_token_61> <time_token_62> it right into the other part, so then we pretty much just pull it tight and then you <time_token_62> <time_token_65> just roll it, just like so, and that's about it, and you are going to get, it's not going <time_token_65> <time_token_66> to always stick right here, so if you need to add a little bit of moisture to it, take <time_token_66> <time_token_68> advantage of that water and just roll it up a couple more times and there you go, simple <time_token_68> <time_token_70> as that, sushi rolls, now to go ahead the next step is you want to go ahead and cut <time_token_70> <time_token_71> it up, you want to get a real sharp knife, now unfortunately my knives, well I would <time_token_71> <time_token_72> love to say I have a real sharp knife but I don't, my knives are getting pretty dull, <time_token_72> <time_token_73> but this, I mean it's doing it okay, what you want to do though is always before you <time_token_73> <time_token_74> cut it, you want to put the knife inside the water like so and then tap it so the water <time_token_74> <time_token_75> goes all the way down before you cut into the sushi, alright pretty much and then you <time_token_75> <time_token_77> cut your sushi up like so, then you just go ahead and lay it out real nicely on a sushi <time_token_77> <time_token_81> dish or a potted dish or a little dish whatever you have, alright, then you can add a little <time_token_81> <time_token_83> bit of garnish right here, you got a little bit of wasabi right there, a little bit of <time_token_83> <time_token_85> pickled ginger, there you go, fresh spicy tuna roll, let's go ahead and give this a shot, <time_token_85> <time_token_88> fresh spicy tuna roll, simple asian cuisine, really tasty, really flavorful, very cost effective, <time_token_88> <time_token_90> you realize you go out to a sushi restaurant and order this, it'll cost 10 bucks, just <time_token_90> <time_token_91> for one, I got enough here to make, oh quite a few, and it cost me about 10 bucks as far <time_token_91> <time_token_93> as ingredients go, and I'm going to have plenty for myself and my kids to go ahead and have <time_token_93> <time_token_93> a lot of fun and munch on, so go ahead and don't be shy, make sure you're going to make <time_token_93> <time_token_94> some mistakes, but go ahead and try it out anyway, this is junkyard, hope you go ahead <time_token_94> <time_token_95> and give this a try, thanks for watching, needless to say, keep cooking!

all the ingredients, but you've got to cook your chicken first. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> Fourth of a cup of light mayonnaise. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> You need a 3 tablespoons of fat free sour cream. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> You need 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, and I just use this lemon juice in the little <time_token_8> <time_token_8> You have a fourth of a teaspoon of salt, a fourth of a teaspoon of pepper, and sometimes <time_token_8> <time_token_9> this is the flavor to taste, so if you put a little bit less, then whoever's eating it <time_token_9> <time_token_9> can put more on there if they want. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> You need two red delicious apples. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> It's about a half a pound of red delicious apples. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> Make sure you get red delicious because they have the flavor and the texture you want, <time_token_11> <time_token_11> so get those. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> A one and a half cups of cubed chicken. <time_token_12> <time_token_12> This is boneless, skinless chicken breast. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> Just use the whole thing, chop it up into about, I don't know, one inch or a half inch <time_token_13> <time_token_13> That's what you want. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> And then you want a one cup of seedless red grapes halved, so you're going to rinse those <time_token_14> <time_token_15> off and cut those in half, and then you want a half a cup of diced celery. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> I think it's about two or three stalks, you'll have to just measure it out once you chop <time_token_16> <time_token_16> it all up. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> And then we want two tablespoons of chopped walnuts, and you've really got to toast these. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> And I'll show you how to toast these in a pan here just a little bit. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> So I'm going to get started chopping some things up, like the apples and celery and <time_token_17> <time_token_18> the grapes, getting them all measured out, and I'll be back. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Okay, I'm on the last thing I'm chopping up. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Here's my apples. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> I've got my chicken measured out, and we've got a cup and a half, I think, of chicken. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> Got everything else. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> The celery's chopped up nice and fine. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> You don't want huge hunks of celery in there. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Got everything else measured out in the grapes. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> I'm cutting them and putting them in a measuring cup. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> You need one cup, so I'm filling up this twice. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> So what I do is I cut them long ways, and then I cut them sideways, just like that. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> Because it says halved, but I like them into fourths. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> Let me get a big one so you can see. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> So I cut it lengthways, like that, and then while I'm holding it, I cut it side to side. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> So then you get these little fourths of grapes, and those are really good to bite. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> They're smaller than bite size, so it really mixes in well with the chicken and everything. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> You can see I didn't use all my apple. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> I still have three sections left. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> What I will probably do, since I have chicken left over, I'm going to have plenty of grapes, <time_token_27> <time_token_28> and I have plenty of celery. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> I've got plenty of everything. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> By the way, that was about two stalks of celery was what that was. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> I will probably make another two, probably two smaller batches of this. <time_token_30> <time_token_30> This will probably make about, I think it makes about four cups, and we'll tell you <time_token_30> <time_token_31> the calories and stuff too, but I think it makes about four cups of just this batch, <time_token_31> <time_token_32> and then I'll make up the rest. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> You can see how much chicken I have left here, which is probably about as much as that. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> So I could probably make two batches. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> I've got enough apple, I believe, and maybe a little less on the second batch than the <time_token_34> <time_token_34> Maybe I'll grab a little bit of this and save it, because I probably scooped it over <time_token_34> <time_token_35> It was probably a little bit of a heaping half cup when I was making them. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> So I could take a handful, not a huge handful, just a piece of those and sit it aside and <time_token_36> <time_token_36> mix it all together and do another batch. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> That way she's got enough to last pretty much all week long to eat these meals, and they <time_token_37> <time_token_37> will last in her refrigerator for about a week. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> So anyway, let me finish getting these chopped up, and I'll show you how to put it all together, <time_token_38> <time_token_38> and how to toast the almonds, I mean the walnuts, and then put it all together. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Okay, I want to show you how you toast walnuts. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> What I do is just get a pan, this is a non-stick pan I have. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> I put it on about medium-high, not medium-high, but about six, a little bit higher than medium. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> It needs two tablespoons of walnuts, so I'm literally measuring out my walnuts because <time_token_41> <time_token_42> you're wanting your calories to be, you know, measurable, you want to have a set of calories. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> And literally I'm going to let it sit there, it doesn't look like much, but that will add <time_token_43> <time_token_43> a lot of flavor, and you get really big pieces like this, and what I'll do sometimes is break <time_token_43> <time_token_44> them into smaller pieces, just to spread out a little bit more, and the flavor will be <time_token_44> <time_token_45> But you don't need big hucks of walnut in there, you just need small pieces. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> But these will, once the pan starts heating up, it will, you don't want to burn them, they'll <time_token_46> <time_token_46> get hot pretty fast. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> You can just break them with your fingers, they're not hard. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> Alright, so while my walnuts, while the pan's waiting to heat up in seven, you'll start <time_token_49> <time_token_50> smelling them, and you just, all you've got to do is shake the pan a little bit to keep <time_token_50> <time_token_50> them from sticking, it's not that big a deal. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> You can even turn the heat up a little bit higher if you want medium-high, make it go <time_token_51> <time_token_51> a little bit faster, you can do that too. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Use your nose, and you'll know, but you don't want to burn them because they get bitter. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> So basically to my chicken, I'm going to add my apples, and just dump them in a big bowl, <time_token_53> <time_token_54> and my grapes, and I just like to add the fruit and the celery first. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> I like to add all the bigger ingredients first, and then what I do is I kind of turn this <time_token_55> <time_token_56> to where it kind of mixes it all together, roughly mixing it together, because you don't <time_token_56> <time_token_56> want any big hunks of chicken in there with nothing else, you really want a little bit <time_token_57> <time_token_57> And then the lemon juice, the lemon juice keeps your apples from turning brown. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> I think that's the only sole purpose for it, actually. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> I'm now going to go ahead and put my sour cream in my mayonnaise, and if you want to, <time_token_62> <time_token_63> go ahead and dump your salt and pepper on top too, but it's kind of sprinkled out because <time_token_63> <time_token_64> you don't want a big ol' bunch of salt and pepper coming in one place, and once you stir <time_token_64> <time_token_64> it up, it'll be fine. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> And this is not going to be a really wet, wet chicken salad. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> It's just going to be more for flavor than anything, it's not going to be a traditional <time_token_67> <time_token_67> It's really just for the flavor, I mean, just to kind of bind it just a little bit. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> And then I'll stir it up more once I get my walnuts, so the walnuts are still going over <time_token_68> <time_token_69> there, so I'm just going to give them a little bit of a shake. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> You can smell it, you can smell it more than anything, and like I said, you don't want <time_token_70> <time_token_71> to burn them, but you can start smelling them, they start smoking just a little bit. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Once you get that, you literally just pour them right in, and you hear a little sizzle, <time_token_71> <time_token_72> and that will add, you wouldn't believe how much flavor those add. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> And they have to be toasted, because just a regular walnut won't add the flavors, because <time_token_73> <time_token_74> when you toast a walnut, it brings out the oils and stuff in the nut, and really brings <time_token_74> <time_token_74> out the flavor. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> So that's it, that's really it, I'm going to give it a little taste for salt and pepper. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Let me see if I can grab a little spoon, I got a little taste, I got a little bit of <time_token_76> <time_token_76> everything in there, it's perfect. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Get that really tender chicken, that crunch of the apple and the celery, the sweetness <time_token_78> <time_token_79> of the grapes, it's wonderful. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> So that's a perfect mix. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> So what I'm going to do now is, we bought these a long time ago, we bought these little <time_token_80> <time_token_80> containers at Walmart, I don't even know if they make them anymore, they probably do, <time_token_80> <time_token_81> they're just rubber made containers, but they have a screw on lid, and they're two cup containers <time_token_81> <time_token_82> if you fill it up to this line on the inside. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> So that's how I portion them out. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Now let's take a scoop, and I get it right up to about two cups. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> And Tammy might want more salt in these, salt and pepper in these, she might want a little <time_token_85> <time_token_85> less, that's what I'm going to do. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> So I'm going to get these divvied out, and she's got a meal for the next, she can eat <time_token_86> <time_token_86> dinner for the next four nights on this, since I made extra, she might actually, I know how <time_token_86> <time_token_87> she is, sometimes she ate this for lunch and at dinner, last time we used to make it, didn't <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Is that what you're planning on doing, this time maybe? <time_token_88> <time_token_88> I don't know, I don't know. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> So anyway, it'll last a good week in the refrigerator, may go longer than that, I think the apples <time_token_89> <time_token_90> and stuff will tend to get a little, start getting a little soft if you wait too long, <time_token_90> <time_token_90> but I may help her get a little bit of it too. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> So anyway, that's it, I hope you enjoyed this recipe, I think it's a good low calorie alternative, <time_token_91> <time_token_92> we will come back, you want to just post the calories or you want me to come back and say <time_token_92> <time_token_92> what the calories are. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> We may be back, or Tammy will just post his text after this, what the total calories are, <time_token_93> <time_token_93> one way or the other, we'll let you know what the calories are. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> Are we going to post the total calories for each? <time_token_93> <time_token_93> For a two cup conserving. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> We'll let you know what they are, one way or the other. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Alright, I'm back, I want to tell you how many calories are in each two cup bowl, it's <time_token_95> <time_token_95> right around 230 calories, we weighed everything as we were going, we calculated the calories <time_token_95> <time_token_96> out based on internet calculations for the different weights, and 230 calories is not <time_token_96> <time_token_97> bad for a two cup serving of that chicken salad. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> So I hope you enjoyed, and we'll catch you next time.

<time_token_7> <time_token_7> Go ahead, question. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> I was gonna say, do you think that kids, <time_token_7> <time_token_8> you could kind of put the oud on it <time_token_8> <time_token_8> and they would think that it was something <time_token_8> <time_token_9> like regular spaghetti? <time_token_9> <time_token_9> They would think it's spaghetti for sure. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> Well you could, you could disguise it. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> You could disguise it, but you wouldn't have to <time_token_10> <time_token_11> because they're really that delicious. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> We're gonna begin now with some heat <time_token_12> <time_token_13> and our shiitake mushrooms inside of our skillet. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Now you're gonna notice that like mushrooms <time_token_14> <time_token_14> are mostly all water. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> So they're gonna suck up whatever oil you put in there, <time_token_15> <time_token_15> they're gonna suck that up. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> So we wanna start cooking with that. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> Now I'm gonna turn the heat on high. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> What kind of oil is that? <time_token_17> <time_token_17> This is a vegetable oil. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> You could use canola, you could use olive oil. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Now, here's what we're gonna do. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> We're gonna make a quick little dressing for this dish. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> So gluten-free soy sauce, okay. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> This is a oyster sauce, <time_token_21> <time_token_22> which has a pretty high sodium content. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> So we're just gonna use a little bit of this <time_token_22> <time_token_23> really for like our salt, okay. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Then we're gonna have a pinch of raw sugar. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> The next ingredient is ponzu, <time_token_25> <time_token_27> which is sort of a lime flavored soy sauce, okay. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> Really, really good. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Any of you eat fish? <time_token_28> <time_token_28> Ponzu on fish, fantastic. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> Now, I'll tell you another great ingredient <time_token_29> <time_token_30> and this is miso. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> This is a red miso, which is made from soybeans. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> So we're gonna add that paste in here and dissolve that. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Is that a spicy flavor, the miso? <time_token_33> <time_token_33> No, no, it's a pretty neutral. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> And then we're gonna have a little sake. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> That really depends if you are into sake or not. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> So now what we're gonna do is, exactly. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> So we're gonna just dissolve that up. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> And now let me show you how quickly this is gonna go now. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> I have red pepper and onions. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> That's the next ingredient. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> As you know, bell peppers, especially red pepper, <time_token_40> <time_token_41> have more vitamin C in them than an orange. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> And you can see how it's really soaked up <time_token_42> <time_token_43> all of the oil, that's okay. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> Don't have to panic, just add a touch more oil. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> It's really no big deal. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Now we're gonna add a little bit flavoring in here <time_token_45> <time_token_45> and then we're gonna put this dish, <time_token_45> <time_token_46> show you how fast this is. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Ginger, garlic, a little bit of green onion. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Sometimes people would love to just take <time_token_48> <time_token_48> a little bit of green onion <time_token_48> <time_token_49> and just kind of do them in pieces like this. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> In a lot of Asian cooking, <time_token_50> <time_token_50> they'll just cut them in big pieces like this. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> Whatever you wanna do. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> If you wanna do that, that's great. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> We'll add those in here. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Now we'll get our flavors all together. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Can you smell that already? <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Yeah. Smells great. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Now is there a protein in this dish? <time_token_55> <time_token_55> Cause one of the things I find so hard <time_token_55> <time_token_56> about being a vegetarian is finding the protein sources. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> I do eat fish, but finding which combinations work. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> The biggest thing that you could do right now <time_token_58> <time_token_59> is this is a perfect dish if you wanna put tofu in it. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Would you like to fry the tofu? <time_token_60> <time_token_60> You could fry it. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> You could put it right inside. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> I'd use a medium to firm tofu. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> Now here's what we're gonna do. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> We're gonna add this really quick. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Our sauce mixture's gonna go inside. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> We're gonna take our udon noodles. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> They look like real noodles. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> Yeah, they are real noodles. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> They look like real noodles. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> And we're just gonna sort of lightly stir fry this. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Oh, that looks so good. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Just lightly stir fry it. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Are the noodles sticky at all? <time_token_69> <time_token_69> And the noodles are a little bit sticky. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> Do you have to do anything with the noodles <time_token_70> <time_token_70> to prepare them or is there already? <time_token_70> <time_token_71> No, I just blanched them so just like spaghetti <time_token_71> <time_token_71> to the al dente. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Now we're just gonna let this cook. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> Now if we wanna get spicy, now watch this. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> This is hydroponic watercress. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> And watercress has just been forgotten about. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> So we're gonna cut it off its roots. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> We're gonna add a little bit of this, <time_token_77> <time_token_78> like a salad almost, to the tray. <time_token_78> <time_token_80> Now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take our udon <time_token_80> <time_token_82> and we're gonna bring this baby right to the platter now. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> And we're gonna just sort of lay this right on the platter. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> And it's gonna wilt the watercress a little. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> This here will just kind of scrape down. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> Now what we're gonna do also to that is very simple. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> We're gonna add a little bit of carrot. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> We're gonna add a little bit of green onion. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> We're gonna add a little bit of cilantro, <time_token_90> <time_token_90> which is gonna add some great flavor to this. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> And then we'll take a little bit more of our watercress <time_token_92> <time_token_93> and just kind of cut it right from the earth. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> And look at that. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> There's our first meatless, meatless, meatless Monday dish.

I already put the first cup. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> Mix the contents in. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Mix everything together. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Then add 2 bottles of an 8 ounce of clam juice. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Just pour the contents in. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> Here's the second one. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> It's been about 5 minutes and it looks like it's boiling. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> So let's go ahead and open it up. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> And this is when we're going to add our clams. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> So let me go ahead and open up those cans of clams. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> And we'll be right back. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Just stir heat to medium and add 2 cans of clams. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Preferably fresh clams would be great, but I couldn't find them anywhere. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> So I'm just using canned clams. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> And whole clams is best. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> I couldn't find whole clams so I had to just settle for chopped clams. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> And the recipe that Justin's grandmother, grandma more gave us <time_token_28> <time_token_29> calls for 2 of these, but I actually used 3 because I really like clams. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> So just add the clams. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> I actually like to keep some of the juice because it's really delicious. <time_token_32> <time_token_32> It's extra clam juice. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> And so here's my third one. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> And just mix everything. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> So now that you have your clams in and it's in medium heat, <time_token_37> <time_token_38> you're ready to add 2 cups of half and half. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> So add 2 cups. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> 2, and I like to use horizon or organic half and half, <time_token_41> <time_token_41> but you can use any you like. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> So that's 2 cups of half and half and you're going to want to just go ahead and mix the contents. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> Doesn't that look delicious? <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Now that the half and half's in there, <time_token_44> <time_token_45> add 10 tablespoons of flour gradually. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> So add 1 and mix. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> 2 and mix. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> And you're going to do this continuously. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> 3, 2, 1. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> This is the sixth one. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> And as you can see, the clam chowder is getting really thick. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Doesn't that look delicious? <time_token_55> <time_token_55> And here's the 10th. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> I'm just going to make it a heaping one. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> That's the 10th one. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> That's actually like 11. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> And then you're going to stir. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> I like to use my little hot pad. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> So as you can see, it's really thick. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> You can add more flour if you like it much more thicker, <time_token_60> <time_token_61> but I think this is perfect <time_token_61> <time_token_62> because it'll get thick throughout. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> Like it'll get thick in time. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Look at that. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> Doesn't that look amazing? <time_token_63> <time_token_63> Doesn't that look good, Hank? <time_token_64> <time_token_65> We're going to add 2 teaspoons of... <time_token_66> <time_token_66> I can't say it, so I had to have Justin say it. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> So 2 teaspoons. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Oh, and it looks like this, by the way, <time_token_69> <time_token_69> if I didn't get it. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> Grab that spatula and mix the contents. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Next, you're going to add any hot sauce that you like. <time_token_71> <time_token_73> And our favorite at home is the Sriracha hot chili sauce. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> And I tried this recipe before, <time_token_73> <time_token_74> which is why I decided to make a YouTube video. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> And you're going to just add 1 teaspoon, <time_token_74> <time_token_75> but if you like it super spicy, <time_token_75> <time_token_76> add 2, but 1 is perfect, I think. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> And then if you like more, just add more. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> And then you're just going to mix. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> And I like to just dip that measuring food in there <time_token_79> <time_token_79> to get all the sauce out. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> And it smells amazing. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> Doesn't it smell amazing, honey? <time_token_81> <time_token_82> After that, I like to add a half teaspoon, <time_token_82> <time_token_83> oops, a half teaspoon of salt. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> After you add your salt, <time_token_83> <time_token_83> just add a little bit of black peppercorn. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is pretty much all I add, <time_token_85> <time_token_85> and then I mix. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> And honestly, you are pretty much done. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> I like to turn everything on medium <time_token_87> <time_token_88> and close it for a little while. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> I just like to have it on medium <time_token_88> <time_token_89> and then close it for about 10 minutes <time_token_89> <time_token_89> because everything tastes much better that way. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> And I set the timer on for 10. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Alright, it's time to open this up. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> It looks delicious. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> And you're pretty much all done. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Just grab yourself a large bowl, <time_token_93> <time_token_94> pour yourself some delicious clam chowder. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> I'm going to do 2 scoops. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> Now that the clam chowder is all done <time_token_95> <time_token_96> and we're eating it, how do you like it? <time_token_96> <time_token_96> It's really, really good. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> I love clam chowder. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> Clam chowder is really good. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> So thank you, friends, so much for tuning in. <time_token_98> <time_token_98> Have a beautiful day.

we're going to make some meatloaf. <time_token_0> <time_token_1> I've had people ask me to do a meatloaf recipe for a while. <time_token_1> <time_token_1> Now, meatloaf, there is all types of recipes out there. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> I'm going to show you one of the ways I do it. <time_token_2> <time_token_2> For my recipe, we're going to need some ground beef. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> I'd recommend a pound and a half to two pounds if you're going to be feeding four to six people. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> If you're only going to be feeding one or two people, you can go with a pound. <time_token_4> <time_token_4> I'm just going to be making a pound. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> This will feed actually up to four people, really. <time_token_5> <time_token_5> But really, if you want a big serving, just like two or three people for a pound. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> We're going to make a sauce for the top of it. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> In my sauce, I add a little bit of maple syrup. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> Some people use brown sugar. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> I choose to use a little bit of maple syrup. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> Ketchup, of course. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> A little bit of mustard. <time_token_8> <time_token_8> I'm going to use some Grey Poupon. <time_token_8> <time_token_8> That's what I have at home, but you can use almost any type of mustard. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> And a little bit of Worcestershire sauce. <time_token_9> <time_token_9> For the meatloaf itself, we don't need all that much. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> We just need the meat, the ground beef. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> We need an egg. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> If you're doing two pounds or a pound and a half or more, you could use two eggs. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> I'm doing a pound here, so just keep in mind I'm using a pound. <time_token_12> <time_token_12> If you want to make more than a pound, just add a little bit more of each ingredient I'm using. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> About a half a cup of finely chopped onion, which mine's frozen. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> I've got to let it defrost a little bit here and then chop it up. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> You need some stuffing mix or breadcrumbs. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> I prefer some stuffing mix. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> You need some milk and some salt and pepper. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> So let's go ahead here and first make the sauce. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> All right, for our sauce, ketchup of course is always used in a meatloaf. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> We're going to use about five to six tablespoons of ketchup. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> So let's go ahead here. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> The first one was kind of half emptied out, so that's why I'm doing six there. <time_token_21> <time_token_23> Then about four tablespoons of maple syrup, and I really recommend you get real 100% maple syrup. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> As you can see here, the ingredients, just maple syrup. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> If you go ahead and get some cheaper other type of syrup, look at the ingredients on this. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> And as you can see, there's tons of ingredients there. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> That's not as good. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> You want to use 100% pure maple syrup if you can. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> So four tablespoons of this. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> And then about two tablespoons of mustard. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> I'm just going to estimate with the mustard because I have to scoop this out and my spoon already has stuff in it. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> So I'm just going to estimate about two tablespoons. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> And then one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, and I'm just going to guesstimate again. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> I'll go ahead and stir that all up. <time_token_36> <time_token_38> And this is going to be the sauce that we use at the end to cover up the meatloaf and give it a nice topped taste. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> It's going to be a really nice sweet but also flavorful sauce, so you end up with something like that. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> So now let's go ahead and make the meatloaf. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> Okay, so now for the meatloaf. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> I'm going to be using one pound of ground beef. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> Get that out of there. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> And then we're going to be using one egg. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Also going to be using a half a cup of ketchup. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Now I'm going to estimate, guys, because I do this a lot, but measure it if you want half a cup of ketchup. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> And a half a cup of milk. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> Again, I'm estimating, guys, but if you want to measure it, go ahead. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> And then about a cup of breadcrumbs or stuffing mix. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> Probably about good. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> And then throw in your onions. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> About a half cup of finely chopped onions. <time_token_50> <time_token_52> And then we're going to want about a teaspoon or so of salt and just a little bit of pepper. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> So I'm just going to estimate this, about a teaspoon of salt. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> And then just like a quarter to a half teaspoon of pepper. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> And then this you could stir up. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Don't stir it too long. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> I'm going to just mix it up with my hands. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Kind of nasty, so I'm going to go to the sink after I'm done with this. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> And I find that with my hands I can get everything mixed in really good rather than with a spoon that just kind of mixes it around. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> This way I'm kind of getting all the breadcrumbs and everything mixed in really good. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> So yeah, I'm going to have dirty hands, but I'll just wash them after. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> So don't stir it or mix it too much. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> It will get too combined. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> You might start breaking up everything if you combine it too much. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> So this is looking good. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> Now all we do, grab my pan here. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Now all we do is take it, put it in the pan, and kind of shape it. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> And now you want to have your oven heated up to 350. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> And we're going to cook it for about an hour. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> And then what we're going to do is add this topping on mostly later, about 15 minutes before it's done cooking. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> We're going to add most of this on. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> But I'm just going to put a tiny bit on now, not too much, just to get some of that flavor going through there. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> But we're going to top it off later with the majority of the sauce 10 minutes before it's done cooking. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> So now we're going to put it in a 350 degree oven for about an hour. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> And at about 45 to 50 minutes, we're going to take it out and put on that extra seasoning. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> So let's go ahead and throw it in the oven. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> All right, so here we go. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> I've got my meatloaf preheated to 350 degrees. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> And I'm going to put it in there for 45 minutes, like I said. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> And then we'll come back with 15 minutes left and throw that extra topping on. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> All right guys, it's been cooking for 45 minutes. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> So now we've got 15 minutes left. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> We have a total hour cook time. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> Now remember, I'm cooking one pound of beef. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> If you were cooking a pound and a half or two pounds, <time_token_80> <time_token_81> you'd probably want to cook this for about an hour and 15 minutes to up to an hour and a half at the most probably. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> So put the majority of this on. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> I might not use it all because I've got plenty here, it looks like. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Try to get it down the sides. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> I'll use a little more. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Get it down the sides and all over. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> And now throw it back in for the last 15 minutes. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> And there we have it. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> After about an hour of cooking, we have the meatloaf done. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> I'm going to give it a second to cool off and then cut off a piece and see how it turned out. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> And here we go. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> Here's our finished product. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> As you can see, it's cooked fully through. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Now if you want, you can use an oven thermometer and you can get precise reading. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> You want this to be 160 degrees in the middle. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> So if you have a thermometer, then you could test it out. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> I'll just go ahead and taste it here and see how it turned out. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> It's probably really hot still. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Oh, it's really good. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> That top glaze tastes so good on there. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> So easy recipe there, guys. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> Pretty simple to make. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> Not too many ingredients. <time_token_97>

Today we're going to make <time_token_2> <time_token_2> buttermilk pancakes. These are really easy to make. You don't need an electric <time_token_2> <time_token_3> mixer, all you need is two bowls, one for the dry ingredients, one for the wet and <time_token_3> <time_token_4> then you just mix the two together and you're done. So we'll start with the dry <time_token_4> <time_token_5> ingredients. In a large bowl I have put one cup that's 130 grams of white <time_token_5> <time_token_6> all-purpose flour and the flour will give us the structure to the pancakes <time_token_6> <time_token_7> and to that I'm going to add one teaspoon of baking powder and a quarter <time_token_7> <time_token_8> teaspoon of baking soda and this will give us light airy pancake, the leavener, <time_token_8> <time_token_9> and a quarter of a teaspoon of salt, that's for flavor, and two tablespoons of <time_token_9> <time_token_10> that's 30 grams of white granulated sugar and the sugar not only adds <time_token_10> <time_token_11> sweetness to the pancakes but it also gives makes them moist and it helps <time_token_11> <time_token_12> with the browning. So I'm just going to use a wire whisk or you just use a <time_token_12> <time_token_13> rubber spatula and just stir everything together. I want to make sure there's no <time_token_13> <time_token_14> lumps and everything's blended. Okay and that's it for the dry and then for the <time_token_14> <time_token_15> wet. Try to have everything at room temperature so take one large egg and <time_token_15> <time_token_16> I'm just going to whisk that. Now the egg gives a nice richness to the batter, it <time_token_16> <time_token_17> binds everything together and plus it helps with the browning and then to that <time_token_17> <time_token_18> I'm going to add three tablespoons, it's about 40 grams, of butter that I've melted <time_token_18> <time_token_19> and then let cool to room temperature and your butter adds moistness and gives <time_token_19> <time_token_21> it a nice tenderness and plus of course some flavor. And last is one cup <time_token_21> <time_token_22> that's 240 milliliters of buttermilk and buttermilk makes, as opposed to milk, it <time_token_22> <time_token_23> makes your pancakes more tender, a little softer. Now I've used like a commercially <time_token_23> <time_token_24> made buttermilk, you can make your own by just taking a cup of regular milk and <time_token_24> <time_token_25> adding like a teaspoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to it and just let it <time_token_25> <time_token_26> stand for 10 minutes or you could use, just have this product on hand, I usually <time_token_26> <time_token_27> have it in the fridge, buttermilk powder and then you can just, you don't have to <time_token_27> <time_token_28> worry about running out to the store, just have it on hand, it tells you on the back <time_token_28> <time_token_30> of the container how to use it. So that's our wet ingredients. So just make a well <time_token_30> <time_token_31> in the center of your dry ingredients and then add all your wet into the <time_token_31> <time_token_32> center there. Now we want to use a light hand when we're mixing this because you <time_token_32> <time_token_33> don't want a tough pancake, so we don't want to mix it over mix it, just enough, <time_token_33> <time_token_34> we only mix it enough so that all the ingredients are blended together and <time_token_34> <time_token_36> when you're just stir gently and a few lumps is fine in a pancake batter. Now <time_token_36> <time_token_37> I'm using just a rubber spatula, you could also use a wooden spoon and just <time_token_37> <time_token_39> gently stir. These have a little more spongy texture than there's a regular <time_token_39> <time_token_40> pancake recipe on the site that uses milk and the difference is this is a <time_token_40> <time_token_41> little more spongy and light, both are good. Of course the buttermilk adds a <time_token_41> <time_token_42> little bit of tang. Okay so that's it and we're done. So now to cook your <time_token_42> <time_token_44> pancakes, I'm using an electric skillet. If you have one of these turn your dial <time_token_44> <time_token_45> to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, that's 180 degrees Celsius. If you don't have this <time_token_45> <time_token_46> just you can just use a frying pan on the stove, try to use a heavy pan with a <time_token_46> <time_token_46> flat surface, you don't want any warps in your pan because then you get uneven <time_token_46> <time_token_47> cooking which we don't want and if you're doing on the stove set your heat <time_token_47> <time_token_48> to medium medium high and what you can tell your pan is ready when you just <time_token_48> <time_token_49> take a little bit of water on your hands and just drop it on and it'll kind of <time_token_49> <time_token_50> splatter and that's when you know it's hot enough. So if you have to adjust your <time_token_50> <time_token_51> heat to get it the right temperature and you might even have to adjust your <time_token_51> <time_token_51> heat as you're cooking the pancake if it's if it's cooking too fast or too <time_token_51> <time_token_52> slow you can just kind of up or down. Now I'm going to just spray with a nonstick <time_token_52> <time_token_53> vegetable spray my skillet that kind of cuts down on your fat if you're worried <time_token_53> <time_token_55> about that. It's nice and easy to do but you could use some oil or melted butter <time_token_55> <time_token_55> and you could either brush the oil or butter on with a pastry brush or with a <time_token_55> <time_token_56> piece of paper towel and then I'm going to use just a ladle of course you can <time_token_56> <time_token_57> make your pancakes as big or as small as you want. If you don't want if you don't <time_token_57> <time_token_58> have a ladle you could just put this in a large measuring cup and then just pour <time_token_58> <time_token_60> it. So I'm just going to and give your if you're going to put a lot of pancakes <time_token_60> <time_token_61> on your in your pan make sure you give enough room for spreading. You can see <time_token_61> <time_token_62> this batter is really nice and thick from the buttermilk and I think <time_token_62> <time_token_63> depending on the buttermilk you buy some are thicker now the one I bought was <time_token_63> <time_token_64> really quite thick so then that's going to affect the consistency of the batter. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> So I'm just so we could now if you have a nonstick surface use a spatula not a <time_token_66> <time_token_67> stainless steel because you don't scratch your surface. So you cook these until the <time_token_67> <time_token_68> tops you'll get lots of bubbles and when some of the bubbles start bursting then <time_token_68> <time_token_69> you'll know. You could also just take your spatula and kind of just take a <time_token_69> <time_token_69> peek underneath because you want the bottom to be golden brown and this will <time_token_69> <time_token_71> take maybe depending on your heat two three minutes. So you can see the top <time_token_71> <time_token_72> they're starting to form some bubbles some of them are even popping. So what <time_token_72> <time_token_72> you do is I always like to just put my spatula and just check and I can see <time_token_72> <time_token_74> that the bottom is golden brown so just take your and just flip of course the <time_token_74> <time_token_75> more you cook these the browner and some people like there's quite light I kind <time_token_75> <time_token_76> of like the more the golden brown a little crisper and then just flip them <time_token_76> <time_token_77> and just cook the other side usually the second side doesn't take as long plus <time_token_77> <time_token_78> you will notice that the bottom side doesn't seem to brown quite as much as <time_token_78> <time_token_79> the top and that's normal. Okay so pancake done as you can see the second <time_token_79> <time_token_80> side you kind of it's not a solid brown it's kind of patchy that's how you want <time_token_80> <time_token_81> it and I have the platter here now I know the tendency is to kind of stack <time_token_81> <time_token_82> them but the problem with that is if you do that is the bottom ones tend to get <time_token_82> <time_token_82> soggy so we don't want that. So try to have a platter or plate and then you can <time_token_82> <time_token_83> just space them flat like this now if you weren't going to serve these <time_token_83> <time_token_84> immediately you could put them in a hundred and seventy five degree Fahrenheit <time_token_84> <time_token_85> oven that's about 80 degrees Celsius and just put them right on top of your wire <time_token_85> <time_token_86> rack and they can stay there 15-20 minutes and so if I want to do another <time_token_86> <time_token_89> batch I would spray again and then just give your batter a stir. Now there's two <time_token_89> <time_token_90> ways if say you didn't want to make all of the pancakes you could just store <time_token_90> <time_token_91> this batter just cover it and store it in the fridge for usually like 24 hours <time_token_91> <time_token_92> and then just give it a real good stir of course not it's not going to be quite <time_token_92> <time_token_93> as good but it's still pretty good or you could just bake off all your pancakes <time_token_93> <time_token_94> and then just cool these and you could put them in the freezer and they'll last <time_token_94> <time_token_95> for about a month and then you could either reheat them in the oven just a <time_token_95> <time_token_96> moderate oven or you could just pop them right into your toaster oven.

"<time_token_4> <time_token_5> Hi guys, I'm Johnny, welcome to another episode of In the Kitchen with Johnny. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> Today I'm going to be showing you how to make pepperoni pizza bites. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> They're so good, so delicious. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> They're perfect for a party, any get together. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> So let me check out the ingredients so we can get started. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> So for the pizza dough you have three options. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> Buy yourself some pizza at your local supermarket, go to a pizza store and tell the guy to sell <time_token_12> <time_token_13> you one pizza dough or make your own pizza. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> I will put a recipe in the description down below how you can make your own pizza. <time_token_14> <time_token_16> I also have a video on making pizza, so there will be no problem for you to make this recipe. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> So the ingredients you will need, here I have pepperoni, I have some mozzarella cheese, <time_token_18> <time_token_20> these are the mozzarella sticks, I cut them in three, but you can also use the block, <time_token_20> <time_token_22> You might want to get a good mozzarella that is nice and gooey and delicious because it <time_token_22> <time_token_23> will make your dough soggy. <time_token_23> <time_token_26> So here I have my pizza dough that I made myself and I'm just going to flour the surface. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> So guys I put my dough in a flour surface and I'm just going to roll it out. <time_token_28> <time_token_31> You can do this with a rolling pin or with your hands and I'm going to form it like in <time_token_31> <time_token_34> a rectangle or so because we're going to cut this in 20 to 24 squares. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> I'm just going to fix this here. <time_token_35> <time_token_37> So I'm going to cut this in squares, I'm just going to cut my dough in half and then I'm <time_token_37> <time_token_41> going to cut them in half again, in half again in the other side and just cut it again <time_token_41> <time_token_42> by the side until you get nice squares. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> So guys the way this goes is that you put like around two pieces of pepperoni on the <time_token_45> <time_token_46> dough then you put a piece of cheese and then if you want you can put another pepperoni <time_token_46> <time_token_47> piece on top and you're going to close it. <time_token_47> <time_token_50> You're going to form it like in a bowl making sure you close, making sure that you don't <time_token_50> <time_token_50> see the pepperoni and the cheese you know. <time_token_50> <time_token_54> You can roll it however you want and I'm going to put them in a 13 by 9 inch square pin that <time_token_54> <time_token_55> I already have done some already. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> So I greased this and I'm going to bake them there. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> I will continue making my pizza bites and I'll show you what to do next. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> So guys I already put my pepperoni pizza bites in my baking sheet I already rolled them out <time_token_60> <time_token_62> and now I'm going to brush each of them with melted butter and we're going to sprinkle <time_token_62> <time_token_62> them with Italian seasoning. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> Just brush them with melted butter and you're going to sprinkle some Italian seasoning. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> This is just my own that I made. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> You can put as much or as little as you want. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> So guys I preheated my oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and we're going to bake this for <time_token_69> <time_token_70> about 20 minutes until they're nice and golden brown. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> So guys I baked my pepperoni pizza bite for exactly 20 minutes and this is how they look. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> I'm just going to take one to taste it. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Look at that. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> That is just beauty. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> So guys I'm going to show you again because I already ate like three of them. <time_token_79> <time_token_83> So I want to show you, let's taste this together, got the cheese, pepperoni, this is so good. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> You can eat this with your favorite marinara sauce and you're good to go. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> So guys I hope you enjoyed this quick, well, quick if you bite your dough, you know, but <time_token_89> <time_token_91> it's a little tight consuming because you have to let the dough rise if you make the <time_token_91> <time_token_91> pizza dough, but this is so easy to make. <time_token_91> <time_token_94> I hope you give this recipe a try, it is so delicious, perfect for get together and if <time_token_94> <time_token_96> you enjoy this recipe give this beer a thumbs up, show me some love and you will see me ", "duration": 309.17, "segments": [[83, 110], [111, 134], [135, 163], [164, 175], [190, 211]],

Welcome to Boner's Kitchen. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> Today I am making 7 layer burrito. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> Let's look at the 7 layers. What are those 7 layer ingredients? <time_token_13> <time_token_14> You can basically choose your own favorite ingredients but today I am going to share my way of preparing this 7 layer burrito. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> So here I have main 7 ingredients ready. <time_token_15> <time_token_19> 1st layer beans, 2nd layer rice, 3rd layer cheese, 4th layer salsa, 5th layer sour cream, 6th layer guacamole, 7th layer you can choose your favorite vegetables. <time_token_19> <time_token_21> Here I have lettuce, some pickled vegetables, I have olive and jalapenos and spring onion. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> And also I am going to need some tortillas. I am using flour tortillas. <time_token_22> <time_token_25> And if you want to make your 7 layer burrito crispy you can bake with butter or oil. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> I am going to use butter. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> I have already shared basics of Mexican. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> Later in this video at the end I will post the links for all these recipes. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> I have already posted recipe video of how to make with fried beans, guacamole, salsa, Mexican rice. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> So you can watch all those recipe videos before you plan out to prepare these 7 layer burrito. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> If you don't want to prepare with fried beans you can use black beans. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> Guacamole I quickly prepared. I just mashed the avocado with fork and added some spices and the guacamole is ready in no time as well. <time_token_34> <time_token_37> I have shared even how to make flour tortillas. You can buy the ready flour mix or I have already shared the recipe how you can make the flour tortilla mix at home. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> So planning out this menu is super duper easy and quick. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> So looking at all these ingredients my mouth is already watering so let's prepare the burrito. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Now I am going to warm up these tortillas a little bit about 10 seconds. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Alright so those are ready and I am going to take this big plate and prepare the burrito on this plate. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Ok so take one tortilla at a time. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Alright so let's start with beans. The first layer beans. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> Second layer rice. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Now you can add as much as you want or as little as you want. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> It's ready to you. You can add your favorite ingredients a little bit more and the one that you don't like you can add less. <time_token_49> <time_token_52> Salsa here, sour cream, guacamole and I love guacamole so little bit more. <time_token_52> <time_token_55> Then I am going to sprinkle cheese, lettuce, olive, spring onion, <time_token_55> <time_token_55> and I got it covered everything. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> Now if desired you can add jalapenos but this is for my kids so I am not going to add jalapenos. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> And ready to roll. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> And I am going to also fold this burrito from the side as well. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> And finish rolling. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> And burrito is ready. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> Alright so here I have three burritos ready. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Now you can serve them just as it is or you can make them crispy again. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> So I am going to make some crispy and some I am going to leave as it is. <time_token_65> <time_token_67> Now when you prepare the burritos make sure that the rolled end goes at the bottom like this. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> So it stays good and it doesn't open up. You can see them. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> Now here I have the pan heating and I am going to add butter on each side. <time_token_70> <time_token_73> And make sure when you bake again keep the end part at the bottom like this. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> So again it doesn't get opened up and once it is baked it will hold its shape so then you don't have to worry. <time_token_75> <time_token_77> And when the first side is nice and golden brown color flip on the other side so you can see nice color. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> So you want to bake on both sides golden brown. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Ok so this burrito is ready to come out. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> I am going to bring down onto this plate here. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> So carefully bring down onto the plate. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> And I am going to bake the rest of the burritos. <time_token_81> <time_token_83> Now if desired you can cut from the middle and I am going to cut diagonally. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> So it looks beautiful. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> You can see all those layers. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Alright so you see inside now it is beautiful. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> You can sprinkle some spring onion on the top. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> Take a look at this yummy plate. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> And I can't wait to give it a bite here. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> This yummy looking beautiful seven layer burrito. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Can't tell you how all those flavors all together brings yummy flavor. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> So this was all about seven layer burrito. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Thank you for watching and I will see you soon with another great episode of cooking.

180..............................................", "asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_2> Hey guys, it's Joanne from Fifteen Spatulas, and today we're going to make New England <time_token_2> <time_token_2> style clam chowder. <time_token_2> <time_token_4> This is a cream-based chowder instead of the tomato-based Manhattan style chowder. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> I just think the cream-based tastes so much better. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> But I don't claim this to be an authentic New England clam chowder. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> There's all sorts of arguments about what that even means because there's so many ways <time_token_8> <time_token_9> that people make New England clam chowder. <time_token_9> <time_token_11> But for my version, there's two things that I like to do. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> First of all, I love using fresh clams. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> I think it just tastes so much better. <time_token_13> <time_token_15> And something about canned clams just kind of weirds me out, and I haven't found a brand <time_token_15> <time_token_15> that I think really tastes good. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> And then the second thing is, this isn't a flour-thicken soup. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> I think sometimes New England clam chowders can be kind of gloopy and thick, if you know <time_token_19> <time_token_19> what I mean. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> And I just don't think that's as delicious. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> I love the texture of this soup. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Let me show you how to make it. <time_token_22> <time_token_24> Start by rinsing two dozen little neck clams, making sure to wash off any mud or sand from <time_token_24> <time_token_26> the outside, and then put them in a bowl and tuck with cold water, and let the clams soak <time_token_26> <time_token_28> for about 30 minutes so they can spit out any sand from the inside. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> In the meantime, chop up one large yellow onion. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> You want to end up with about two cups total for this. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> And when the clams are done, rinse off the clams again, and then add them to the bottom <time_token_33> <time_token_34> of a soup pot, and cover with a half cup of dry white wine. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Turn the heat to high, and cover the pot with a lid. <time_token_36> <time_token_38> Let the liquid come to a full boil, and then give the clams about four to five minutes <time_token_38> <time_token_38> to open up. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Then you can remove the clams from the liquid. <time_token_39> <time_token_41> And sometimes the clams are stubborn to open and might need a little bit more time, but <time_token_41> <time_token_42> if any of them don't open after seven to eight minutes, throw them out. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> The clam liquid this time around was a bit muddy, so I discarded it, but if it looks <time_token_44> <time_token_46> relatively clear, you can strain out any sand in a paper towel lined strainer and incorporate <time_token_46> <time_token_47> that into your chowder, but you'll be fine without it as well. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Clean the pot out and add three strips of thick cut bacon. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> This is about four ounces. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> And while that cooks and crisps up, you can remove all of the clams from the shell with <time_token_52> <time_token_54> Remove the bacon from the pot, and blot some of the excess bacon fat with a paper towel, <time_token_54> <time_token_55> and then add all of your yellow onion. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> And stir and cook that for about 10 minutes to soften, scraping up any of the brown bits <time_token_57> <time_token_57> from the bottom of the pan. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> Next add two eight ounce bottles of clam juice, that's two cups, and add an extra cup of water <time_token_60> <time_token_61> as well, and bring that to a boil. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> In the meantime, dice up a large half pound russet potato, add that to the chowder, and <time_token_63> <time_token_65> simmer the potatoes for about 10 minutes until tender. <time_token_65> <time_token_67> Crumble up the bacon and add that and the clams to the chowder, then add a half cup <time_token_67> <time_token_69> of heavy cream, stir that in, and then I like to add a little pinch of cayenne pepper, <time_token_69> <time_token_71> give that a stir, and make any necessary salt and pepper seasoning adjustments, and it's <time_token_71> <time_token_72> ready to serve. <time_token_72> <time_token_75> I've got a bowl of my chowder here, just getting a spoonful with clam, bacon, potato, and onion <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Let's give this a taste. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> Oh my gosh. <time_token_79> <time_token_82> This is just spectacular, I mean the flavor is just the perfect blend of that sweet cream <time_token_82> <time_token_83> dairy and that sea briny clam. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> It's so good, the sweetness of the onion, the meatiness, the smokiness from that little <time_token_85> <time_token_87> bit of bacon, it's nice and hearty from those potatoes, and they thicken the broth ever <time_token_87> <time_token_89> so slightly, but it's still got a really nice consistency to it. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> I absolutely love this chowder so much. <time_token_90> <time_token_92> Well, I hope you guys enjoyed learning how to make this recipe and I hope you give it <time_token_92> <time_token_94> I think it's a nice, simple recipe, but it still has so much flavor and it's so good. <time_token_94>

<time_token_2> 350 and then go start chopping your garlic and your onions if you're going <time_token_2> <time_token_3> to add them now if you have finicky children like mine were they may not <time_token_3> <time_token_4> like onion and garlic so you can just leave this first two steps out if you <time_token_4> <time_token_6> wish but I decided to trick my children and I started adding just a little bit <time_token_6> <time_token_7> of onion and a little bit of garlic at a time and I chopped it up very very good <time_token_7> <time_token_8> the smaller it is the less likely they'll notice it but they will notice <time_token_8> <time_token_10> the flavor and just think it's yummy so I just chop and chop and chop until I <time_token_10> <time_token_11> feel like I just can't chop anymore and as you'll see these pieces are very very <time_token_11> <time_token_12> tiny next step is the eggs and I like to use eggs from free-roaming hens and I <time_token_12> <time_token_13> gotta tell you one time my daughter and I were in the grocery store in the <time_token_13> <time_token_14> produce section and we weren't sure where the eggs were so we asked the <time_token_14> <time_token_15> produce man we said do you have any free-roaming eggs and he was standing <time_token_15> <time_token_16> next to a cooler and he and he put his arms he stretched his arms out and put <time_token_16> <time_token_17> it around the cooler he said no I don't have any free-roaming eggs he said I <time_token_17> <time_token_18> make all my eggs stay right here it was hilarious and we laughed about that for <time_token_18> <time_token_19> quite some time oh yeah you just saw me sniff those eggs I like to smell my eggs <time_token_19> <time_token_20> to make sure they're fresh before I add them to my meatloaf so just beat them up <time_token_20> <time_token_21> really good and then take a pack of crackers you know the kind I'm talking <time_token_21> <time_token_22> about those kind that are very good for you and just smash them up really really <time_token_22> <time_token_23> good while they're in the package and that way you don't have much of a mess <time_token_23> <time_token_24> you know because all the crumbs stay right inside of there I like to get <time_token_24> <time_token_24> these really really small because when you get a big piece of cracker in your <time_token_24> <time_token_25> meatloaf it just isn't good so make them really really tiny smoosh them good <time_token_26> <time_token_27> next is your tomato sauce I don't have a special preference I just normally buy <time_token_27> <time_token_28> whatever's on sale you can use whatever kind you want you just need one can and <time_token_28> <time_token_29> about a pound to a pound and a half of lean ground beef I like to use the lean <time_token_29> <time_token_30> stuff and there's less grease in there you know and it's better and healthier <time_token_30> <time_token_31> for you and I use about a half a can of the tomato sauce in the burger the cold <time_token_31> <time_token_33> burger make sure that burgers cold and a one sauce probably about two tablespoons <time_token_33> <time_token_34> I just eyeball it the same with what's this here sauce about two tablespoons I <time_token_34> <time_token_35> guess just you know sprinkle it over the top but the trick is to a good meatloaf <time_token_35> <time_token_36> that melds together and holds together and doesn't fall apart is the meat must <time_token_36> <time_token_37> be cold yeah add some of this ketchup in here now all these liquidy items they're <time_token_37> <time_token_39> gonna help your meatloaf hold together then your onions and your garlic put <time_token_39> <time_token_40> that in there if you're going to and your free-roaming eggs and of course the <time_token_40> <time_token_41> crackers and you pour the crackers in now you're gonna mix this up you're not <time_token_41> <time_token_43> gonna mix too long that's the key to if you overwork the meatloaf it's gonna get <time_token_43> <time_token_44> warm from your hands and it will fall apart when you cut it so so a little bit <time_token_44> <time_token_45> of garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste and if you're superstitious like I <time_token_45> <time_token_46> am but have a bad memory and you spill the salt I just pick a little up and <time_token_46> <time_token_47> throw a little over each shoulder because I could never remember which <time_token_47> <time_token_49> shoulder to throw it over so anyway mix your meatloaf and like I said don't play <time_token_49> <time_token_50> around in there too long just get it so that all the crackers are wet and mixed <time_token_50> <time_token_51> in there real good and then shape it up and put it in the pan just like patty <time_token_51> <time_token_53> cake hmm okay when I'm shaping the meatloaf into the pan I like to make a <time_token_53> <time_token_53> little well I press down with my hands to make a little well on the top of the <time_token_53> <time_token_55> meatloaf for later okay so now it's time to put your meatloaf in the oven and I <time_token_55> <time_token_56> like to cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil that way if there's any <time_token_56> <time_token_57> grease splatters it'll make for easier cleanup later and less chance for a fire <time_token_57> <time_token_58> so we set our timer to 45 minutes and then we go on and prepare the rest of <time_token_58> <time_token_59> our meal while we're waiting for our meatloaf to cook and today we're gonna <time_token_59> <time_token_61> have Dolly's famous potato pancakes okay some yummy garlic and onions chopped and <time_token_61> <time_token_63> Lowry's salt and then we're gonna put in some Jane's crazy mixed up salt I <time_token_63> <time_token_63> don't know if you can get this in your town because when I first moved to <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Florida I had to talk my grocer into ordering this for me we have it in Ohio <time_token_64> <time_token_65> but when seven years ago when I came to Florida they didn't have it but this is <time_token_65> <time_token_66> an essential ingredient for potato pancakes and of course more garlic <time_token_66> <time_token_67> powder and salt and pepper to taste and the key again folks is cold potatoes <time_token_67> <time_token_68> very cold that holds them together when they're cooking and they won't fall <time_token_68> <time_token_70> apart on you okay but again your potatoes must be very cold so if you <time_token_70> <time_token_70> have leftover mashed potatoes from last night's meal get them out and make some <time_token_70> <time_token_71> potato pancakes with them don't mess around in there too long just like with <time_token_71> <time_token_72> the meatloaf hurry up and make your patties and remember the temperature of <time_token_72> <time_token_73> your oil is very important and I like to use extra virgin olive oil just like <time_token_73> <time_token_75> Rachel Ray got to have something healthy going on in this meal and like I said <time_token_75> <time_token_76> the temperature is very important I try to cook mine medium heat okay so I just <time_token_76> <time_token_77> take a little bit of the potato the cold potato and I put it in the pan and when <time_token_77> <time_token_79> that starts sizzling I know that pan is ready for my potato pancake and now when <time_token_79> <time_token_80> I start to see little crispy things growing around the outer part of the <time_token_80> <time_token_81> potato pancake I know it's time to flip it so be careful with this part that you <time_token_81> <time_token_82> don't get that hot oil on you because it will hurt you just flip it over and look <time_token_82> <time_token_84> there nice golden brown potato pancakes I love them they're so yummy it's <time_token_84> <time_token_85> important to cook your potato pancakes in a Teflon pan and my daughter only has a <time_token_85> <time_token_87> small Teflon pan so I have to cook one at a time and I like frozen corn or <time_token_87> <time_token_88> fresh corn I don't really care for canned stuff so I'm heating up some of <time_token_88> <time_token_89> that as well all right now when your buzzer rings at 45 minutes then take <time_token_89> <time_token_91> your meatloaf out and pour the the other half of that tomato sauce that you saved <time_token_91> <time_token_92> pour that over the top and cook it for another 15 minutes and voila we have <time_token_92> <time_token_94> home-cooked comfort food don't want to eat this very often because it really <time_token_94> <time_token_95> isn't that healthy for you but it sure is good and it is comforting now watch <time_token_95> <time_token_96> how this stays together as I slice it and serve it on the plate it's all <time_token_96> <time_token_97>

"asr_text": "<time_token_7> <time_token_8> Welcome to Japanese Cooking 101. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> Today we are going to make miso soup. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> Let's take a look at the ingredients. <time_token_10> <time_token_14> We have 4 cups of dashi or fish broth, 1 package tofu, 4-5 tbsp miso paste and 2 green <time_token_14> <time_token_15> onions finely chopped. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> Miso paste is a paste made from fermented soybeans used to season soup, sauce and other <time_token_19> <time_token_20> There are different kinds of miso by color, texture and flavor. <time_token_21> <time_token_23> You can find miso at some grocery stores these days in the refrigerator or Asian food aisle. <time_token_23> <time_token_26> If you have a Japanese or Asian market nearby, you can certainly find more varieties or you <time_token_26> <time_token_27> can just order one online. <time_token_27> <time_token_30> Dashi used here is Japanese fish broth and it is a key flavor factor of miso soup. <time_token_30> <time_token_34> We explain more details in our dashi recipe video and on our website JapaneseCooking101.com. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> It is easy to make and very flavorful. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Ok first we are going to cut tofu. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> There is no right or wrong way to cut tofu but you can just slice it in half and then <time_token_39> <time_token_40> cut it into bite size pieces. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> You can use both soft and hard kind tofu in a soup. <time_token_42> <time_token_45> You can also use vegetables, seafood and meat in miso soup instead of tofu. <time_token_45> <time_token_47> You can make it harder by adding more stuff or make it simple like this one. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> It's all up to you. <time_token_48> <time_token_50> As I said before, to make good miso soup, you need good dashi. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Here is a quick recap from our dashi video. <time_token_52> <time_token_55> All you need to do is to put a couple of handfuls of bonito flakes into boiling water and cook <time_token_55> <time_token_56> for a few minutes and strain it. <time_token_56> <time_token_59> It's really simple and we explain all about it in our dashi recipe video. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Now we have 4 cups of dashi already made in the pot. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> We then put the tofu in and heat it on medium heat until the tofu is hot. <time_token_65> <time_token_67> You don't need to bring it to a boiling point because tofu is delicate but just to the point <time_token_67> <time_token_68> that it's heated through. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> If you are using other ingredients such as vegetables, seafood and meat in miso soup, <time_token_70> <time_token_72> you can bring it to boil and cook until everything is cooked through. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> Now we add miso paste. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> If you have a small strainer like this, it's easy to just dump miso in and dissolve miso <time_token_76> <time_token_77> directly in the pot. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> If you don't have one, you can just use a ladle. <time_token_79> <time_token_81> You don't need to strain miso paste but strainer just makes it easier to stir it in the pot <time_token_81> <time_token_82> without breaking tofu. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> Finally you put some green onions and remove from heat. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> Looks great doesn't it? <time_token_85> <time_token_88>

Welcome to Asian at Palm. And today I'm going to show <time_token_3> <time_token_5> you how to make bulgogi with cinco. Bul means fire, gogi means meat. So the meat cooked <time_token_5> <time_token_7> on the fire, like direct from the fire, is bulgogi. That is where the name comes from. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> But nowadays, bulgogi is a Korean signature made of meat that you cook on either stove <time_token_8> <time_token_10> or grill or however you want to cook. So first, we are going to make bulgogi sauce. So what <time_token_10> <time_token_12> you need, five cloves garlic. And it's a mixing bowl. And I'm going to use half of a large <time_token_12> <time_token_13> sized onion, very thinly sliced. I made bulgogi so many times in time of my life and I ground up <time_token_13> <time_token_15> the onion in the sauce or just no onion at all. I just add it later whenever I start frying. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> But actually thinly sliced onion in the sauce is best. And I will add a little bit green onions. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Cut one inch long pieces. And if you are using a little more thicker green onion, <time_token_17> <time_token_19> cut it half lengthwise. And we will need a little bit of asian pear. I really like the pear flavor <time_token_19> <time_token_20> in my bulgogi sauce and actually it tenderize the meat as well. If you don't have it or you cannot <time_token_20> <time_token_22> find asian pear, you can skip it. You still can make it without it. Okay. I'm just going to ground <time_token_22> <time_token_23> my pear in this special browner. I found it in the kitchen store somewhere. I don't remember <time_token_23> <time_token_25> exactly. But if you don't have this, obviously you can use this cheese grater. It works perfect to ground <time_token_25> <time_token_26> either daikon or some pears or other fruits into the sauce. Perfect tool right here. Two heavy spoons <time_token_26> <time_token_28> of ground pear. Flavorful vegetables and tenderizers are in my mixing bowl. I'm going to put all the <time_token_28> <time_token_29> sauces. I'm using tempius kanjang. This soy sauce, guys, let me tell you, it's probably the best <time_token_29> <time_token_31> soy sauce. It's amazing. So you will need three tablespoons of sandwich sauce, one tablespoon <time_token_31> <time_token_33> of sake, and one tablespoon of mirin, seasoned rice wine. If you don't have sake, you can use <time_token_33> <time_token_34> red wine. Actually, dried red wine will work great on the bulgogi sauce as well. Two tablespoons of <time_token_34> <time_token_36> sugar, one tablespoon of good quality sesame oil, and quality spoon of salt, and quality spoon of <time_token_36> <time_token_37> black pepper. And half tablespoon of sesame seeds. I want to make sure the sauce is all incorporated <time_token_37> <time_token_39> together first. And I'm going to add one pound of red wine. And this is actually from a Korean store. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> They cut red wine for red bulgogi, which is very thinly cut. And red wine is actually commonly used <time_token_40> <time_token_42> for red bulgogi in Korea. So if you cannot buy this meat, and I understand because I've been <time_token_42> <time_token_43> in the place where I cannot buy this kind of cut of meat at the store, and even though I asked <time_token_43> <time_token_44> butcher, they wouldn't do it because I guess it's like extra work to do it. So I understand it's <time_token_44> <time_token_46> hard to get in some places. What you can do is purchase a chunk of red wine and freeze it in the <time_token_46> <time_token_48> freezer about one hour to two hours. Now all the way through, we just try to freeze it the outside <time_token_48> <time_token_49> part of the ribeye so it's easily cut. And just mix everything together carefully because the beef <time_token_49> <time_token_51> meat is easy to break down. Well if you want me over here, then that means you stop. You're like come on. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> I remember my first youtube video. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Something about soy sauce and sugar and sesame oil and just make this work in a better place. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> You can marinate at least 30 minutes to overnight. So it's really depending on <time_token_57> <time_token_58> how good you are planning your meal. And you can cook on the stove, just on the skillet, <time_token_58> <time_token_60> just it's okay or start frying it. Or you can cook on the grill like how I am about to do today. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> All right, our bulgogi is done. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> It's like a bulgogi porn right here. I'm about to have all the gas in just by smelling it. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> Let's serve this on the plate. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Perfect. The half bulgogi with a little green onion. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Sesame oil drizzle and finish with some sesame seeds. And there you have it, bulgogi. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> You can eat bulgogi with just like this, with bowl of rice. It's perfectly delicious. But how <time_token_74> <time_token_76> I would like to eat is bulgogi, rice, wrapping in the lettuce. For that, we need a little sauce. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> This is ssamjang. Ssamjang is a Korean dipping sauce, the mixture of gochujang, <time_token_77> <time_token_79> which is Korean red pepper paste, and duenjang, just bean paste. So they are together and a little <time_token_79> <time_token_81> more seasoning. And tada, ssamjang right here. It's really great with a Korean barbecue sauce. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> So I'm going to serve ssamjang together with my bulgogi. So on the lettuce, put warm cooked rice <time_token_82> <time_token_84> and put bulgogi, ssamjang. And if you want, you can add a slice of garlic and pepper, <time_token_84> <time_token_85> and maybe a slice of cucumber kimchi as well. Tada! <time_token_86> <time_token_87> In Korean food, chang, which is a primitive sauce, super important for the taste, <time_token_87> <time_token_89> and sambil to your right. If you like to buy bulgogi recipe, give me a thumbs up. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> And subscribe to my channel for more inspirations and ideas of Asian home cooking. <time_token_90> <time_token_92> Thank you so much for watching me today.

254..................................................................", "asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_1> One of the most frequently requested recipes on The One-Pot Chef Show is for mashed potatoes. <time_token_1> <time_token_3> I've never quite understood why, because it seemed like such a simple recipe I was <time_token_3> <time_token_4> surprised that so many people emailed me asking for this particular recipe, until I did a <time_token_4> <time_token_6> bit of research and discovered that virtually no cookbooks or online sites have very specific <time_token_6> <time_token_6> recipes for mashed potato. <time_token_6> <time_token_8> They often request it for other recipes, but do not actually give a specific way of cooking <time_token_8> <time_token_9> So I thought, I'm going to remedy that situation by putting together a nice little video, <time_token_9> <time_token_10> showing you how to make two different versions of mashed potato. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> The firm version that pretty much everyone's used to, and a nice soft creamy version that's <time_token_12> <time_token_13> suitable for piping or just having the nice sloppy version that everyone loves. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> So it's mashed potatoes, other One-Pot Chef. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> So mashed potatoes, now the first thing that people need to learn when it comes to mashed <time_token_21> <time_token_22> potatoes is consistency is everything. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> You've got to get the right consistency in order to make sure it all stays together nicely. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> If you put too much of one thing or not enough of another, it's going to turn into a mess. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> So first of all, I have peeled and chopped one kilo of potatoes. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Now I'll just, this is in water at the moment, so I'm just going to take one of these out. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> As you can see, it's a very small piece, about maybe one to two centimetres square, <time_token_31> <time_token_32> about an inch piece roughly. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> You need to have small pieces. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Smaller pieces will cook quicker and more consistently. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> It's like any other kind of cooking, the smaller the food, the quicker and better it cooks. <time_token_35> <time_token_37> So we've put this in some water, just going to put the lid on, and we're going to bring <time_token_37> <time_token_38> that to the boil and let it boil for about 15 to 20 minutes. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> At which point we can take a piece out, test to see if it's cooked properly, the way you <time_token_40> <time_token_41> take it out, give it a bit of a press with your finger, and if it sort of smooshes up, <time_token_41> <time_token_42> you know it's ready to go. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> So we'll start boiling this, and I'll show you what to do next. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> Well, it's been 15 to 20 minutes, and we've just finished boiling the potatoes. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> I've drained them off with a sink. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> So first thing we're going to do is just mash them up with our potato masher. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> Right, we've got rid of all the big lumps out of that. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> As you can see, because we've cooked them the right way, they're nice and smooth for <time_token_50> <time_token_54> So we're going to throw in about a tablespoon of butter, and we're just going to stir that <time_token_54> <time_token_55> through until it's all melted through. <time_token_56> <time_token_59> Mixing with salt and pepper, and just stir that through to combine it. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> Now at this point, you can add some garlic if you want to make garlic mashed potatoes. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> You could add cheese if you want to make cheesy mashed potatoes. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> Basically this is your firm, basic mashed potatoes done. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> So you can serve as is. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> If, however, you want to make it that smooth, creamy stuff, especially if you're trying <time_token_66> <time_token_68> to make it a bit fancy and you can use like an icing piper or something like that to sort <time_token_68> <time_token_69> of make an arrangement on the plate, then we can add something else. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> You can use sour cream. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> You can use thickened cream. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> I'm going to use a little bit of milk. <time_token_71> <time_token_74> We just add a small amount at a time, about up to half a cup at most, and you just slowly <time_token_74> <time_token_75> add it until you get the consistency that you're looking for. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> As you can see, I'm just adding a little drizzle at a time, and you can already see that's <time_token_78> <time_token_78> becoming a lot smoother and fluffier. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> Ooh, messed, messed, messed. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> That's looking fabulous, just like that. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Maybe a little bit more. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> And that's looking just about right there, so I don't think we'll add any more there. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> So that's about a quarter of a cup of milk all up there. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> As I say, consistency is the key. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> You've just got to add a little bit at a time until you get what you're looking for. <time_token_90> <time_token_92> And there we have perfect creamy mashed potatoes and perfect firm mashed potatoes. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> First time, every time. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> Well, I hope you've enjoyed this recipe. <time_token_94>

Squishy Monster and today we're going to do spicy sausage and kimchi <time_token_4> <time_token_4> It's going to be quick, simple, and delicious. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> And if you don't want this to be a meaty variety, you can always substitute crumbled tofu. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> If you don't want this to be spicy, you can just omit the red pepper flakes, but you <time_token_7> <time_token_8> can steam this fried and make this into a soup and all of those different varieties <time_token_8> <time_token_9> will be posted on my blog at SquishyMonster.com. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> The first thing I'm going to gather up are my filling ingredients. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> In my big bowl here, I just have a couple cups of finely minced kimchi and some uncased <time_token_12> <time_token_13> So then I'm going to add a few things. <time_token_13> <time_token_15> I'm going to add on top, directly on top of the sausage, my soy sauce and my sesame oil. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> Then I'm going to just for some burst of freshness, some green onions, some garlic and some ginger. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> You can add jives as well. <time_token_19> <time_token_21> Then in my palm, I'm going to add in about a palmful of red pepper seeds, red pepper <time_token_21> <time_token_22> flakes, seeds and all. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> Like how much depends on how spicy you want it? <time_token_23> <time_token_24> I'm going to run it through my palms just to release some of its oils and add it into <time_token_24> <time_token_25> my sausage, on top of my sausage. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> So basically making a paste of sorts. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> I just added in one craft egg and that will help bind the whole mixture together. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> Before I use it or scoop it up into my wonton skins, I'm going to put this whole mixture, <time_token_30> <time_token_31> this whole filling into the refrigerator for about 20 minutes just for everything to melt <time_token_31> <time_token_32> together or to kind of firm up. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> You can just gather the edges like this and then crimp. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Basically I guess make like a free form box of sorts. <time_token_35> <time_token_37> All four edges you gather them together and just kind of slush the edges together just like this. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> So it makes a little three dimensional package of sorts. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> So do whatever way works for you. <time_token_39> <time_token_41> There's like a thousand ways to do this but just do whatever is easiest for you or what <time_token_41> <time_token_41> shape you desire. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Just have fun with it. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> I have in my little pot right here a couple inches of water and when you take the top <time_token_44> <time_token_45> off you'll see that I've put in an elevated, I don't know what you call this, like a <time_token_45> <time_token_46> mesh stand upright contour. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> I have no idea what this is called. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> But in order for the dumpling not to stick and the water is simmering below but not touching <time_token_48> <time_token_50> this elevated contraption, I have some wax paper or some parchment that I'm going to <time_token_50> <time_token_52> put down and I'm going to start laying my dumplings down. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> And they're going to take about 15 to 20 minutes or so. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> So just keep your eye on them and if you want to make sure you just kind of cut into <time_token_54> <time_token_56> one to see but just lay your dumplings on a single layer just like so. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> And then you're going to put the top on so it steams through. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> To make the dipping sauce I usually use this one or another one and I'll post both on my <time_token_60> <time_token_60> I have some soy sauce, some dark smoky soy sauce. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> To that I'm going to add in the juice of one fresh orange. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Squeeze the juice in there. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> Just to brighten up the muddle sometimes soy sauce can have a dark kind of muddle taste <time_token_65> <time_token_67> So just to brighten it up I have some freshly squeezed orange juice. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> So that I'm going to add in some agave or honey, whatever you have or whatever you like <time_token_69> <time_token_69> or whatever is on sale. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> Just drizzle that in there. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> And

<time_token_11> <time_token_12> So I got a couple of cheeses here that I like to use, and really, any combination of cheese <time_token_12> <time_token_13> So, I'm using a nice white cheddar, I'm using a sharp cheddar, I'm using a little bit of <time_token_13> <time_token_15> fontina, a little bit of gouda, and I'm gonna finish off with some of that processed sort <time_token_15> <time_token_15> of American cheese product. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> Please don't frown at me, okay? <time_token_15> <time_token_16> I know what you're saying, but I gotta tell you, what that does for the cream factor in <time_token_16> <time_token_17> mac and cheese, I think, is absolutely fantastic. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> So, I'm just getting my cheeses all prepped up here, I'm gonna go ahead and drop them <time_token_18> <time_token_19> in our food processor and get all the cheese grated and get it ready to go for a mac and <time_token_21> <time_token_24> Alright, so there's the cheese that we got grated up, super simple to do, I mean, the <time_token_24> <time_token_25> food processor is totally the way they go, plus what happens is that sometimes, you know, <time_token_25> <time_token_25> you get the cheese, when you buy it in bulk, it's a lot cheaper, because I don't know about <time_token_25> <time_token_26> you, but cheap is a little pricey, you know, it's a little expensive, but this is great. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> So, put it in the food processor, if it's slightly chilled, it's gonna go ahead and <time_token_27> <time_token_28> cook up and grate up just a little bit better, but totally the way it'll work. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> And listen, try any combination of cheese you like, I'm using this combination just <time_token_28> <time_token_30> because I love the way the flavors mix together, the cheddar cheeses, and the fontina, and <time_token_30> <time_token_30> the gouda, I think it's just fantastic. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> So, this is great, and what we're gonna do to make sure it's super creamy, is we're <time_token_31> <time_token_32> gonna add in some delicious sour cream, I'm gonna use a light sour cream, and I gotta <time_token_32> <time_token_33> tell you, the reason I use the sour cream is because I remember, I'm a grandma's boy, <time_token_33> <time_token_34> you know, and I remember when my grandmother was sitting and was doing her last time, some <time_token_34> <time_token_35> of her last times here with us, she, you know, she was at home, and she was sort of bedridden, <time_token_35> <time_token_36> and her sister, my aunt, my aunt's trainer, she would come over every day, and she would <time_token_36> <time_token_37> cook my grandmother whatever she wanted to have for dinner, and I would just watch in <time_token_37> <time_token_38> amazement as this woman would come in the house and effortlessly just sort of whip up <time_token_38> <time_token_39> these fantastic, these meals, and I gotta tell you, it was so good eating. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> And I remember watching her one time make macaroni and cheese, and she put sour cream <time_token_40> <time_token_40> in the mac and cheese, and I said, oh my god, what is that? <time_token_40> <time_token_41> But when you taste it, you don't really taste sour cream. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Yeah, it gives it a little bit of that tang that happens with sour cream, the old zippy <time_token_42> <time_token_43> stuff that happens, but I gotta tell you, what this does for the cream factor in that <time_token_43> <time_token_44> mac and cheese is, it's beyond phenomenal. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> So that's what we're gonna do today. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> I'm gonna pay a little bit of homage to my aunt's trainer and that time period, and I'm <time_token_45> <time_token_46> gonna do a little sour cream, and it takes me back to some really, really fond memories. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> And that's what cooking is about, you know?

<time_token_3> people in France and the rest of the world eat it at very special occasions. <time_token_3> <time_token_3> So we've made one today for Christmas and New Year's. <time_token_4> <time_token_4> We're going to be fine. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> We have here a 900 gram foie, a liver, which normally they're about 600, so ours is quite <time_token_5> <time_token_6> And what we're going to do is we're going to prepare the foie and we're going to put <time_token_6> <time_token_7> it in the terrain and then we're going to put it in the oven at 140 degrees Celsius <time_token_7> <time_token_7> for an hour and a half. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> Okay so there's actually two lobes to the foie, the liver, and what you need to do is <time_token_9> <time_token_9> you need to open it in between the two lobes. <time_token_9> <time_token_11> So you cut in between the two lobes, open it up, and you need to de-vein it. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> And you need to take out the part that is reddish. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> My mother-in-law's helping me because I've never done this before. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> So you actually have to just sort of pull the veins out. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> I'll cut them out like, there we go, and just sort of, there we go, part that's red. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Just sort of scrape over to clean it out. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> So we're opening it up to try to get this one vein out here, or just sort of do it with <time_token_19> <time_token_20> your hands and sort of, just exactly like with shrimp actually, and you're just trying <time_token_20> <time_token_21> to take out this vein, there it is, and do it with your hands because you don't want <time_token_21> <time_token_22> to cut into the organ. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> And just pull it out. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> There you go. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> Close it back up. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> So we're just going to clean up a little bit, a little bit like surgery. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> And we're getting all the red off. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> So you use a paper towel and go over it. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Keep turning it over so that it's clean. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> So we have here about 21 grams of Golsan, which is like sea salt, ground pepper, and <time_token_34> <time_token_35> The pho is now de-veined, and what you do is you put your 21 grams of salt, pepper, <time_token_35> <time_token_36> and cat hospice on a plate so that you can marinate the pho, the liver. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> There we go. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> And so you just do a little back and forth here. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> So make sure that you get it nice and covered because this is the spice. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> This is what's going to make it really good. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> And what changes, I suppose, I would imagine, are different recipes of pho, because the <time_token_43> <time_token_44> liver itself, of course, tastes pretty normal. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> And then I just put it right in. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> This is my first time doing this. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> I've never done it before, so anything's possible. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Make sure you get the spices all over, a little bit like marinating a steak, same basic <time_token_50> <time_token_51> principle, except no Worcestershire sauce. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Okay, so then take the rest of your salt and <time_token_57> <time_token_58> pepper, sprinkle it on, it's a little bit messy. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> And so now we let that sit for six hours, and we're going to come back and do the rest <time_token_60> <time_token_62> Okay, so it's been six hours, and this has been cooling off in the fridge where we've <time_token_62> <time_token_62> already prepared it. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> And so now what we've done is we've taken, this is what they call in France, a bain-m\u00e9lie. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> And what we're going to do is we're going to put water in it and put it in the oven <time_token_64> <time_token_64> at 140 degrees until it starts to frizz a little bit, so it's just a little baby bubble. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> I've gone ahead and warmed the water a little bit so that we can go a little bit faster. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> There we go. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> And then I'm going to go ahead and put this in the oven to warm up. <time_token_71> <time_token_73> And what we're going to do with the final step is to take cognac, we all have an moniac <time_token_73> <time_token_74> and cognac here, and my father-in-law said that probably cognac would be the best. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> So what we're going to do is we're going to take two tablespoons of cognac, and we're <time_token_75> <time_token_75> just going to drizzle it on top. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> So here we go with one, drizzle it on top and around the edges, sort of bathe it on <time_token_76> <time_token_77> top, and two. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> This makes the fava even more French, because cognac, of course, is French. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> There we go, from the region of cognac, which is near Empeldau. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> Okay, so now the full is at 140 degrees constant, and so we've got the bain-m\u00e9lie, which is <time_token_80> <time_token_80> And what we're going to do is pull this out just a little bit. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> What we want to do is place the fava, which we recently put into the terrine, into the <time_token_82> <time_token_84> bain-m\u00e9lie, and the water needs to go 50% up the terrine, close, into the middle of <time_token_84> <time_token_85> And we're going to leave it in there an hour and a half. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> We heard the little ding-ding. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Now we're going to take it out. <time_token_85> <time_token_87> We're going to take out just the terrine so that we don't get all this hot water on us. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Be careful not to burn yourself. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> It's a little bit more difficult to do. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> Let's see here. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> Maybe I'll just take this big black thing out. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> That's easier to do. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> Put it up here on the stove. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> There we go. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> And let's see what it looks like. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> Whoo, look at it. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> And all that liquid there is going to freeze up, and that's what becomes the yellow, well, <time_token_91> <time_token_92> it's fat, the yellow fat all around the fava. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> We did it. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Let it cool for one hour, and then put it in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours <time_token_93> <time_token_93> before you eat it. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> So now it's the next day. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> We're going to see what it looks like.

It's always a pleasure to have you here with me today <time_token_1> <time_token_3> We are making super soft chapatis that are designed to always impress <time_token_3> <time_token_3> Now you need one cup all-purpose flour <time_token_4> <time_token_4> one cup atta flour <time_token_5> <time_token_6> Salt to taste and an optional pinch of sugar mix everything well and then proceed to add <time_token_6> <time_token_7> two tablespoons of vegetable oil <time_token_7> <time_token_9> Rub in the oil to the flour until it looks crumbly and then next add lukewarm water in small amounts <time_token_10> <time_token_11> The advantage of doing it this way is that it reduces the risk of you ending up with <time_token_11> <time_token_13> A dough that is on the sticky side hence making it hard to handle or a dough that is too hard <time_token_13> <time_token_14> And hence your chapatis turn out hard <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Once your dough comes together <time_token_15> <time_token_15> Then you will proceed to the next step <time_token_15> <time_token_18> I like mine slightly on the sticky side once i'm done because it gives me the soft chapatis that i'm after <time_token_18> <time_token_19> Slightly just a bit and add on top <time_token_19> <time_token_20> This helps when your kneading sorry doesn't stick to your hand <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Notice how my dough is slightly on the sticky side <time_token_21> <time_token_22> So I knead it by pinching and pulling it slightly away from me <time_token_23> <time_token_24> And I do this for about five minutes by then the dough stops sticking on my hand and it's ready <time_token_25> <time_token_27> Apply it lightly and then take a clean fill or a damp kitchen towel and cover your dough for about 15 minutes <time_token_27> <time_token_27> And this is how it looks very soft and pliable <time_token_28> <time_token_29> Proceed to divide it into lemon-sized balls <time_token_29> <time_token_30> This is dependent on the size of your pan <time_token_30> <time_token_32> If you divide it into the lemon-sized balls, then you're going to end up with about eight to nine chapatis <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Lightly dust your balls in the flour <time_token_33> <time_token_33> and shake off the excess <time_token_34> <time_token_36> Stretch it out a bit makes it easier to roll. I also press mine down slightly with my knuckles <time_token_36> <time_token_37> And then I roll it out to about five to six inches <time_token_38> <time_token_39> After which take oil and apply lightly don't apply too much oil <time_token_39> <time_token_41> Because this will end up with you having chapatis that are dripping with oil <time_token_42> <time_token_42> Take your dusting flour again <time_token_42> <time_token_43> And place your rolled-out dough on it <time_token_44> <time_token_44> with the oiled side first <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Pat it down lightly then turn it over and do the same to the other side <time_token_45> <time_token_48> The purpose of doing this is the flour is going to help you to keep your layers distinct <time_token_49> <time_token_49> Place it on your work surface and then fold it like a fan <time_token_50> <time_token_50> That's how you do it. So you fold <time_token_51> <time_token_51> Pat it down <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Again, look at it again <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Pat it down <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Once you're done folding take it and press all your folds together <time_token_55> <time_token_56> And as you're pressing the folds together try and stretch it out slightly <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Then next proceed to roll it out <time_token_57> <time_token_59> Rather roll it together and tuck in your end and as you're rolling it apply a bit of tension <time_token_59> <time_token_59> And this is how it looks <time_token_59> <time_token_61> After about 15 minutes of resting notice, you cannot even see the flour that we applied in between the layers <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Again dust it before rolling it shake off the excess flour <time_token_63> <time_token_65> Press it down slightly to give it some definition and shape and makes it easier to roll out <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Proceed to roll to a diameter of five to six inches <time_token_66> <time_token_67> And then meanwhile ensure that you have placed your pan on heat <time_token_67> <time_token_69> So that it can warm up and you apply a bit of oil using the kitchen towel or tissues <time_token_69> <time_token_70> This will prevent your chapati from sticking on your pan <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Place it on the pan and let it stay for about a minute before you disturb it <time_token_71> <time_token_72> You'll notice the color changing and the bubbles appearing on top <time_token_72> <time_token_74> You will know it's time for you to turn it so come and turn it and then apply your oil about a tablespoon <time_token_75> <time_token_76> I like doing mine from the edges because this makes it easier to spread the oil <time_token_76> <time_token_78> The chapati pan is concave in shape and so the oil automatically by gravity is going to flow towards the center <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Now turn it over and apply oil on the other side <time_token_79> <time_token_80> Again, notice how I like applying my oil <time_token_80> <time_token_80> From the edges <time_token_81> <time_token_82> It flows towards the center and then I spread it <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Make sure you touch every part of that chapati <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Then turn it over and check the first side that was cooking <time_token_84> <time_token_85> If it's not cooked to your satisfaction, you can always turn it back and cook it again <time_token_86> <time_token_86> In this instance, it's not cooked to my liking <time_token_87> <time_token_88> So I turn it over again and cook it for a few more seconds <time_token_88> <time_token_89> As I check on the second side how it's done <time_token_89> <time_token_89> The second side is not done to my satisfaction <time_token_89> <time_token_91> So I turn it over again and cook it for a few more seconds. The first side <time_token_91> <time_token_92> I'm happy with it. So I won't cook it again <time_token_92> <time_token_93> The second side I'm now satisfied and then I take the chapati off the heat <time_token_94> <time_token_94> You can serve it with <time_token_95> <time_token_95> A stew of your choice.

We planted our cabbage from seed last spring. It is an old Irish <time_token_5> <time_token_8> variety called Gorta Hawk. Since October we have been harvesting cabbage. It is January <time_token_8> <time_token_11> now and the cabbage kept well despite frost and rain. The outer leaves start to turn brown <time_token_11> <time_token_13> but further in the cabbage is still perfect and today we are going to make sauerkraut. <time_token_14> <time_token_17> In Ireland people don't really eat much sauerkraut. Where I grew up we had it for breakfast, lunch <time_token_17> <time_token_21> and dinner. So literally all the time and I quite miss it sometimes. I have a special <time_token_21> <time_token_24> cabbage grater which my mum gave to me and I can shred the cabbage with ease. The cabbage <time_token_24> <time_token_29> head is not very tight so I have to keep pushing it together while I grate. It is very sharp. <time_token_33> <time_token_36> Now I weigh the cabbage because I want to add the right quantity of salt, 1 to 100 for <time_token_36> <time_token_39> sauerkraut. So for these 1.5 kilos I need 15 grams salt, approximately 1 tablespoon. <time_token_40> <time_token_43> I also add a capsule of lactic acid bacteria. I could also use buttermilk which would work <time_token_43> <time_token_46> just as well to start the fermentation process. Then I start massaging the cabbage with my hands <time_token_46> <time_token_48> and soon there is liquid running off the cabbage which is good. When it looks like this I stop <time_token_48> <time_token_52> and fill the cabbage into preserving jars. I make sure to divide the liquid evenly between jars. <time_token_54> <time_token_57> Then I crush the cabbage further with a rolling pin. Because we don't eat that much sauerkraut we <time_token_57> <time_token_59> make it in small jars rather than one of those big sauerkraut earthen pots. It's more practical. <time_token_59> <time_token_63> I put a clean cabbage leaf on top and push everything down once more. It is important <time_token_63> <time_token_65> that the cabbage is completely covered with liquid as the fermentation process is unaerobic <time_token_65> <time_token_68> and would be disturbed if air could reach the cabbage. The jars remain room temperature for <time_token_68> <time_token_71> two days then we move them into a cool room for two weeks. Then we have a first look. Some people <time_token_71> <time_token_74> wait for six weeks but we find that often the crowd is sour enough after two weeks. Oh dear, <time_token_74> <time_token_77> this one looks like it's not gone according to plan. It looks a bit rotten and it smells very foul. <time_token_77> <time_token_80> Sometimes this can happen and we just throw it out. This jar looks and smells good. <time_token_81> <time_token_84> You can see how the crowd rose during fermentation and the liquid is at the bottom. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> Some people try to avoid this by putting a weight like a stone on top of the crowd. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> Okay, so how does it taste? Well let's try. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Sour and crunchy. Sour and crunchy, is it all right? It's very nice. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> And not one leaf was wasted in the process.

have your skewers, which mean shish, that's where the word shish kebab comes from. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> This is the shish. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> And I have some filet mignon that's cubed up into nice sized pieces. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> I like to use filet because it's lean and it's very tender. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> We have some salt, black pepper, and of course seven spices. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Now some people like to use steel skewers or aluminum skewers and some people like to <time_token_20> <time_token_21> use wood skewers. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> Wood skewers are so much easier because you can throw them away when you're done. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> But what you need to remember is if you're going to use wood skewers, make sure you soak <time_token_22> <time_token_23> them in water before you use them. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> That way the wood won't burn while you're barbecuing the shish kebabs. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> Now if you don't want to get filet, and I know you're probably thinking, oh my god DD, <time_token_26> <time_token_27> it's so expensive, it's very well worth it. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> But if you don't use filet, try and use another meat that's a little bit marbly with some <time_token_28> <time_token_29> fat because other meats aren't as tender as a filet. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> So you're going to need the fat and the other meats to keep the meat tender. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Chuck would be too dry. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> Try using thigh meat, leg meat, maybe the back meat, any kind of meat that has a little <time_token_33> <time_token_33> bit of fat to it would go great. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> If you're going to use the filet, you don't need to have a lot of fat in the meat because <time_token_34> <time_token_35> the filet itself is very tender. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Now we have our vegetables that are cubed. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Some people also like to use mushrooms, different kinds of vegetables, whatever vegetable you <time_token_37> <time_token_38> like you can put it in between the meat as a barbecue. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> We have our filet that's cubed. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> I'm going to add about a teaspoon and a half of salt. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> Just like that. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> We're going to add some fresh black pepper. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> Try and use fresh black pepper, it has a much more flavorful taste than if you get it ground <time_token_43> <time_token_44> And these are pretty cheap, you can get them at any store for a couple of bucks. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> So just like that. <time_token_45> <time_token_47> We're also going to add a teaspoon or two of seven spices, seven spices gives it a nice <time_token_48> <time_token_49> I'm also going to add just some olive oil, it helps the meat brown nice and crispy while <time_token_49> <time_token_50> it's on the grill. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> Just a couple tablespoons of olive oil. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Now we're going to mix this up. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Yes, use your hands, it's okay to use your hands, if you don't like using your hands <time_token_52> <time_token_53> and just wear gloves while you're cooking with the meat. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> Just like that. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> And then what we're going to do is we're going to alternate the chunk of meat with a chunk <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Now at this point you want to make sure your grill is preheating. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> You want it on a medium high heat because this is very tender meat so you're going to <time_token_59> <time_token_60> cook it just like you would cook a filet steak if you like medium rare or medium rare. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> So I'm going to leave about an inch at the end of the skewer, poke in your meat. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> I'm going to use a piece of onion and I'm going to put, it's all up to you, you can <time_token_64> <time_token_65> put alternate meat, vegetable, meat, vegetable, you can do two pieces of meat, one piece of <time_token_65> <time_token_66> vegetable, whatever you like. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> So just like that, see, put it on a plate and then we can do some peppers in this one, <time_token_68> <time_token_70> use green pepper and these are nice Christmassy colors too so if it's around Christmas time <time_token_70> <time_token_71> you can use the red and the green, see, Christmas colors, it's kind of fun. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Put the green pepper, put another piece of meat, just like that, see how pretty that <time_token_73> <time_token_75> So you just keep going until you're done and then when you want to barbecue them, you want <time_token_75> <time_token_76> to barbecue them, if you like them medium well, you want to do about seven minutes on <time_token_76> <time_token_78> each side, if you like it medium rare you want to do about five minutes on each side. <time_token_78> <time_token_80> So just like that, I'm going to finish these up and I'm going to barbecue them and I'm <time_token_80> <time_token_80> going to show you how to plate them up. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> We are done grilling, I want you to take a look at this. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> I just served them over some pita bread, you're going to serve them over some brown rice with <time_token_86> <time_token_87> the vermicelli noodles, that recipe is on my website as well, see how they get all nice <time_token_87> <time_token_90> and grilled, look at this, look how that comes apart, it's so tender, look at that, it's <time_token_90> <time_token_93> so juicy, unbelievable, the best grilled kebabs you will ever have. <time_token_93> <time_token_95> You have to try this, it's so simple, even if it's winter time, even if it's summer time, <time_token_95> <time_token_97> even if it's raining, turn up that grill, try these shish

I'm gonna show you how to make some old-fashioned buttermilk <time_token_2> <time_token_4> fried chicken oh yeah baby so what you want to do is get your favorite chicken <time_token_4> <time_token_6> pieces that you enjoy the best and wash them real clean dry them off with a <time_token_6> <time_token_9> paper towel and put them in a bowl and cover them with salt and pepper on both <time_token_9> <time_token_11> sides salt and pepper to your taste okay now stir them up there and be sure <time_token_11> <time_token_14> you do both sides really well okay now once you get them all seasoned up real <time_token_14> <time_token_17> good I want you to cover them with buttermilk just like that okay and then <time_token_17> <time_token_19> inside that buttermilk we're gonna squirt us some Frank's red hot sauce you <time_token_19> <time_token_20> could use whatever hot sauce you want stir it up real nicely and then marinate <time_token_20> <time_token_23> it in the refrigerator for at least three hours okay now onto our flour I'm <time_token_23> <time_token_25> gonna get three cups of all-purpose flour one tablespoon of salt one <time_token_25> <time_token_27> tablespoon of black pepper freshly ground and one tablespoon of garlic <time_token_27> <time_token_30> powder okay now stir it up real good with your fork once you get all that in <time_token_30> <time_token_32> there and make sure you mix it very very well and once you get it mixed really <time_token_32> <time_token_34> really really well once you take your pieces out of the fridge and don't knock <time_token_34> <time_token_36> all the buttermilk off of them that's what makes them crispy and then do like <time_token_36> <time_token_38> this cover them completely with your flour mixture shake off any excess and <time_token_38> <time_token_40> kind of lay it aside there okay now we're gonna come in with every one of <time_token_40> <time_token_42> our pieces and do exactly the same thing okay very simple you just want to make <time_token_42> <time_token_44> sure you get all the nooks and cranny covered with your flour mixture okay <time_token_44> <time_token_48> just like so kind of sticking with this a little bit show you has done oh yeah <time_token_48> <time_token_50> baby and then I kind of like to let that settle a while while my pan is <time_token_50> <time_token_52> getting up to heat you know I'm saying so that's peanut oil there and I'm <time_token_52> <time_token_54> filling it up enough to where it will not splash over onto the heat and start <time_token_54> <time_token_56> a fire you have to be real careful when you are frying now this is a walk I use <time_token_56> <time_token_58> a walk that's my favorite utensil and there's what that chicken looks like <time_token_58> <time_token_59> after it's set for a while kind of starts getting little dryness in a few <time_token_59> <time_token_62> areas and once your grease gets up to 350 degrees get you at the monitor out <time_token_62> <time_token_64> and check it you want to make darn sure it's good and hot because if it's not <time_token_64> <time_token_65> your old chicken just won't look good you know I'm saying all right now we're <time_token_65> <time_token_67> gonna drop our chicken into our very hot grease very carefully and I'm gonna put <time_token_67> <time_token_69> every bit of it in there at one time okay now I only cook for two people and <time_token_69> <time_token_72> we do a lot of wings but you can might have to do two batches okay and I'm a <time_token_72> <time_token_73> firm believer that once you put your chicken in you don't mess with it you <time_token_73> <time_token_75> don't mess with it at all and start till it starts getting a little bit brown and <time_token_75> <time_token_77> then all you do is do what I'm doing there just kind of real gently flip them <time_token_77> <time_token_79> over you know I'm saying so they don't knock off all the goodies oh yeah baby <time_token_79> <time_token_81> and then all of a sudden they start to get beautifully golden brown and that's <time_token_81> <time_token_84> kind of your thermometer when they get to be that golden brown right there folks <time_token_84> <time_token_86> after about 20-25 minutes of frying them babies are done you know what I mean now <time_token_86> <time_token_88> I like mine really crispy and you may not want yours as crispy okay so you <time_token_88> <time_token_90> decide well there's what mine look like and maybe a pretty little plate there <time_token_90> <time_token_93> with some green beans corn the cob boys good really crispy and delicious well <time_token_93> <time_token_95> y'all I hope you give this a try and I hope you subscribe and I hope you tell

"<time_token_2> <time_token_4> Hi guys, I'm Sanyam Longest. Welcome to Asian at Home. And today I'm going to show you how <time_token_4> <time_token_7> to make Spicy Fried Rice. Yeah, it's hot, spicy, you need this in your life. It's so <time_token_7> <time_token_9> good, it's super easy. Let's get started. First, the rice. Using cold jasmine rice is <time_token_9> <time_token_11> the best. Cold rice normally observe all the sauces better than warm rice. Their texture <time_token_11> <time_token_12> is amazing as well. So make sure your rice is very cold. And I'm going to chop up some <time_token_12> <time_token_14> fragrant vegetables, which is garlic, ginger and green onion. So you will need two cloves <time_token_14> <time_token_15> of garlic and chop it. And I'm going to grate some ginger with my cheese grater, about two <time_token_15> <time_token_17> teaspoons. And last, fragrance vegetables, all green onions. I'm using really, really <time_token_17> <time_token_19> thin green onions, but regular sized green onions, four is perfect. Now I'm going to <time_token_19> <time_token_20> chop up my yu choy. You can substitute to Chinese broccoli, regular broccoli or any <time_token_20> <time_token_22> other green vegetables. I really like yu choy because they cook really, really fast. I'm <time_token_22> <time_token_23> just cutting diagonal angle. So about the bite size. All right, time for my protein. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> I have this beef chuck sliced. I'm going to cut into bite sizes. And next, pork belly. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> Oh yeah. You can use regular other cut of pork or bacon. Well, it doesn't matter. Or <time_token_27> <time_token_28> I'm not using pork at all because the protein is totally your choice. Now I'm going to bake <time_token_28> <time_token_30> some eggs. You will need two eggs for this recipe. And you might notice that I am preparing <time_token_30> <time_token_32> almost everything right now. It's because while you're cooking, you do not want to stop cooking <time_token_32> <time_token_34> and you will be on high heat for entire time. So you want every ingredient you want in your fried <time_token_34> <time_token_35> rice is ready to go right next to your wok. In two eggs, I'm going to add two teaspoons of <time_token_35> <time_token_38> sriracha. Oh yeah, we are going to spice up every single thing. Season the eggs with little salt <time_token_38> <time_token_40> and peppers and beat the eggs. All right, we are almost there to prepare it. The last is <time_token_40> <time_token_42> maca sauce. Oh yes, spicy fried rice sauce. It's the best. Four teaspoon of soy sauce, four teaspoon <time_token_42> <time_token_44> of sambal, which is chili garlic paste, and four teaspoons of chili oil. And I'm using this <time_token_44> <time_token_46> Chinese chili oil that has actually two dried chili peppers inside of this chili oil. Of course, <time_token_46> <time_token_48> you can back down the spiciness for your taste or bump up even more. This is just perfect for my <time_token_48> <time_token_50> taste. I mix up everything together. I'm going to pour my sauce over the rice because I'm going to <time_token_50> <time_token_51> add my sauce and rice at the same point. All right, now we are going to move all this next to <time_token_51> <time_token_53> my stuff, next to my wok, so we can start cooking. Let's go. All right, I'm going to turn my heat up <time_token_53> <time_token_55> the highest one that I can get. When your wok is hot, add about two tablespoons of cooking oil <time_token_55> <time_token_57> and we're going to add all the garlic and ginger onion. Cook about 30 to 40 seconds until you can <time_token_57> <time_token_59> smell all the fragrance from them. Now add all your protein. When all your protein is browned up, <time_token_59> <time_token_61> we are going to add eggs. Push your protein aside and pour your eggs. Pour like scrambled eggs. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> And do not mix up with the protein yet because we want the egg to be fluffy itself. Now mix everything <time_token_63> <time_token_66> together. And now time to add the rice, sauce, and the yu choy. This is super fun to cook fried, right? <time_token_66> <time_token_69> They're just like adding, coating, fire, yeah! I'm just cooking about a minute. So all the yu choy, <time_token_69> <time_token_71> cook through and warm it up and rice, absorb all the sauce together. All right, let's serve on the <time_token_71> <time_token_74> serving dish. Fried rice is done. You've got to smell this. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> If you have this, why do you need Chinese takeout? Oh my god, this is like a million times better. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> Give me thumbs up if you really like my spicy fried rice because I will give myself a thumbs up. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> And subscribe my channel for more inspirations and ideas of Asian home cooking.

Peel 2 cloves and then just coarsely mince them. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> I'm using half of a very small sweet white onion. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> Slice it into wedges lengthwise. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> Take 3 or 4 green onions, slice off the bottom roots, and then cut them finely. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Next, take your Chinese broccoli, or whatever green leafy vegetable you're using, <time_token_32> <time_token_34> and cut 1 big leaf in half first, and then slice it into 1 cm sized strips. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> I got all of the ingredients prepped and ready to go. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> I'm going to light up the fire and heat up my wok, <time_token_36> <time_token_37> but I just want to say that in order to make good kau pad, <time_token_37> <time_token_39> you need to use rice that has, actually day old rice works very well, <time_token_39> <time_token_40> but if you take it out of the rice cooker, just make sure it's cooled down, <time_token_40> <time_token_41> and even if it rests for a couple hours, that's a good idea <time_token_41> <time_token_42> and it will make for better fried rice because it's a little drier. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Turn on your stove and add about 1 tablespoon of oil for frying. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Make sure the oil is nice and hot before you drop in the garlic. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Stir fry the garlic for about 15 seconds or so, and then add your shrimp. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Cook the shrimp, stir fry continuously for about 30 seconds, <time_token_47> <time_token_47> and then add half of your rice. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> This is a little trick. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> The little bit of rice first is going to soak up all those delicious shrimp juices. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Just a few seconds later, scoot your rice to one side of the wok and crack in an egg. <time_token_50> <time_token_52> Kind of whirl that egg around and then start to mix it up with your shrimp and rice. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Now stir fry until your egg looks like it's cooked all the way through. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Then toss in the rest of your rice, give it a quick stir, <time_token_54> <time_token_55> and then add half a tablespoon of soy sauce, half a tablespoon of oyster sauce, <time_token_55> <time_token_56> and just a tiny pinch of sugar. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Stir fry for another 15 seconds or so, <time_token_58> <time_token_59> and then toss in your Chinese broccoli and the sliced white onion. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Fry the rice for another 30 seconds and then toss in the green onions. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> A few more seconds and it's ready. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> Remove it from the heat and dish it onto a plate. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> When you order kapad in Thailand, <time_token_64> <time_token_65> your plate will normally come with an extra wedge of lime on the side, <time_token_65> <time_token_66> a sprinkle of pepper on top, <time_token_66> <time_token_67> and of course that wonderful prik nam pla, chilies, and fish sauce, <time_token_67> <time_token_68> which is a typical condiment found on every street food table. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> One thing is for certain when you're cooking in Bangkok, <time_token_69> <time_token_70> you will sweat profusely, but it's worth the end result. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> So you can see this kapad gung, <time_token_71> <time_token_72> it has a really beautiful orangy pink tinge to it, <time_token_72> <time_token_74> and that comes from those oils from that shrimp head. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> I'm going to first give it another squeeze of lime to top it off. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Love that extra hit of lime juice all over the kapad. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> First step of any bite of kapad is to take some of the prik nam pla, <time_token_77> <time_token_78> get some of those chilies going and some of the fish sauce, <time_token_78> <time_token_79> put that on top, and beautiful. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> Oh, that's delicious. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> I love that little sour tinge from the lime juice, <time_token_83> <time_token_84> the hit of saltiness from the prik nam pla, <time_token_84> <time_token_85> and that heat from the chili. <time_token_85> <time_token_87> Just a good classic lunch dish right there. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> So thank you so much for watching this recipe for Thai kapad gung. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Be sure to try it out, and also give this video a thumbs up, <time_token_89> <time_token_90> comment below, and I'll see you

I'm going to add in my flour. I will put the <time_token_4> <time_token_7> full ingredients down below because I'm only doing half a recipe here. Add in my cornmeal, <time_token_8> <time_token_13> my sugar, salt, and baking soda. And I'm just going to take a whisk here and whisk this <time_token_13> <time_token_17> together. Just make sure that the dry ingredients are incorporated together. Now to this I'm <time_token_17> <time_token_23> going to add in my milk as well as an egg. Excuse the yarn. I'm just going to whisk this <time_token_23> <time_token_26> together until it comes together. Now that this is mixed together and smooth, I'm going <time_token_26> <time_token_29> to set this off to the side and start working on the hot dogs. For the hot dogs I've just got <time_token_29> <time_token_31> plain old regular hot dogs here. You can use all beef if you'd like. These just happen to be cheap <time_token_31> <time_token_37> ones because they were on sale. Anyway I'm going to cut these into thirds just like so. And I'm <time_token_37> <time_token_40> going to put these into a bowl here that just has some flour in it. I'm just going to coat these <time_token_40> <time_token_44> with the flour so that way the batter sticks better to them. Alright so I went ahead and shook <time_token_44> <time_token_48> off all the excess flour on my hot dogs. And what I'm going to do is take these and I have my oil <time_token_48> <time_token_52> heated to 350 degrees over medium heat in a saucepan. And I'm just watching that. All I'm going to do <time_token_52> <time_token_56> is do these in small batches since I'm using a small pan here to fry these in. I'm just going <time_token_56> <time_token_60> to put these into the batter and cover these. Make sure that they get completely coated in your <time_token_60> <time_token_67> batter. And then just go ahead and fish them out one by one and carefully lower them into the oil. <time_token_67> <time_token_70> And these don't take very long at all to fry up maybe just a few minutes. They will automatically <time_token_70> <time_token_76> turn themselves when they are done. And while these are cooking you want to make sure monitor <time_token_76> <time_token_78> the temperature of your oil so it doesn't get too hot. You'll need to adjust your burner heat <time_token_78> <time_token_82> either up or down to make sure that it stays right around 350 degrees. And when they're a nice <time_token_82> <time_token_85> golden brown go ahead and carefully lift them out and put them onto a paper towel lined plate or a <time_token_85> <time_token_88> wire rack if that's what you have. And then go ahead and finish frying up the rest of your hot <time_token_88> <time_token_91> dogs. And once you get all your corn dogs fried up this is what they will look like. Hope you <time_token_91> <time_token_92> guys enjoy and thanks so much for watching.

<time_token_5> <time_token_6> Let me make the dough first. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> For the dough, you require refined flour which is bread flour or maida as we call it. <time_token_7> <time_token_11> So refined flour, baking powder, baking soda and sieve this up. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> So this refined flour, I'm going to add some salt and sugar, some powdered sugar, salt <time_token_14> <time_token_15> and I've got some yogurt. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> So yogurt into this, most people also add eggs to naan but I know naan is so popular <time_token_17> <time_token_18> and there are so many vegetarians that everybody thinks we should get a vegetarian recipe. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> Hence this one is a vegetarian recipe. <time_token_19> <time_token_21> So let me make a dough, now to this we need to add some milk, no water while kneading <time_token_21> <time_token_23> the dough, milk and because I'm making garlic naan, let me also add some fresh coriander. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Let me chop the fresh coriander and add it to the naan dough. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> Chop coriander, milk and let's mix this up to form a nice dough, try to avoid using water <time_token_27> <time_token_28> because you're making a vegetarian dough, it should be nice and soft. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> I'm doing a garlic naan, hence I've added chopped coriander but generally people don't <time_token_30> <time_token_30> add chopped coriander. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> For the garlic naan, yes you do add. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> So this dough is now ready, I will ferment it for sometime around 30 minutes, cover it <time_token_32> <time_token_33> with a cloth and keep it for 30 minutes. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> So as the dough becomes nice, light and fluffy, then we'll make garlic naan. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> For the garlic naan, you need to chop some garlic, when you have nice big cloves of <time_token_36> <time_token_37> garlic, you can press it with the back of your knife, it gets chopped easily. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> So this is one easy way of chopping garlic, you all love garlic naan. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> I know of my family, whenever they dine outside, daughters would definitely ask for garlic <time_token_40> <time_token_42> Only if you see in the western cuisine also, we all love garlic bread, right?

<time_token_17> <time_token_18> Of course you were. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Go ahead and put a pot with just vegetable oil. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> You want it to get to about 350 degrees so it will fry this up really nicely. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Go ahead and grab your whisk now and you're going to whisk that together. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> You don't have to worry about it if one's thicker than the other because you're going to fry. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> They're already cooked. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> We just are frying them to get the breading round. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Can you eat them just a raw hot dog? <time_token_22> <time_token_22> You could eat a raw hot dog but it doesn't really taste great. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> You made the browning that makes it taste good or at least warm. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> But you can eat a cold hot dog. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> I know those can be in the sausages. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> You can eat those cold. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> That's basically a hot dog. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> Those aren't good though. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> Some people love them. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> Some people do. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> My dad used to eat those a lot. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> I got this situation happening. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> I should have said that you just want to add it last. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> Should I pour the milk over top of this or something? <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Here's a trick. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> If you're filling it stuck in a beater, just spread it open. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> You see how easy that came out? <time_token_29> <time_token_29> You did a perfect. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> Just spread it open. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> So now go ahead and you're going to add the bottom out. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> What's your favorite Tim Burton movie, by the way, since we're done with that? <time_token_31> <time_token_31> You know I have a soft spot for every instance of hands. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> Oh, that is a good one. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> It's where my little writer wins the same. <time_token_32> <time_token_32> She just didn't steal yet. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> Oh, she was so cute. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> I'm a big Mars attacks fan. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> I like Mars attacks. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> I don't know. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> I didn't know that was Tim Burton. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Oh my gosh. <time_token_35> <time_token_35> I love that one. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> And Batman Returns. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> Actually, I think that's my favorite. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> So this is what it looks like. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> It looks great. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> You want to see that? <time_token_38> <time_token_38> So here's what's more than you now. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> It makes it easy to dip these Frankenweets. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> So go and pour that batter into that cup. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Here's how we're going to make these Frankenweets. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> I'm going to push these up a little bit so that the spike is not there. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> We don't want somebody biting down and getting a little surprised. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> In order to have the cornmeal batter stick to the corn dog, rather to the hot dog, I'm <time_token_44> <time_token_44> just going to coat it with a little bit of flour. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> That was a little bit. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> It's getting real intimate right now. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> Now you're going to go ahead and take that hot dog. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> I go in there once. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> That's way better. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> And you're just making sure it's coated and giving it a little bit of a gravity swish <time_token_49> <time_token_50> to make sure that kind of the extra comes off. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> And then we're going to just drop it right into the grease. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> And I want to turn it just to make sure that it doesn't stick to the batter. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Now as we said, this oil is at 350 degrees. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> So which is best to do it one at a time? <time_token_54> <time_token_54> You can do it one at a time. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> For me, it helps you have control. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> Yeah, I get a balanced cut. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> Yeah, the more things you put in front oil, the lower the temperature gets. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> It actually drops it. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> It has to do with the energy exchange and we'll get into the nerd alert of that. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> But when you do it one at a time, it makes sure that the one thing cooks perfectly. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> That would be great, Dale, if since this is raw and this is hot, <time_token_58> <time_token_58> to sprinkle it a little bit of a fine sea salt. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> It just makes a little gourmet, you know? <time_token_59> <time_token_60> And you want to do it while the mixture when it first comes out of the oil <time_token_60> <time_token_60> so that the salt sticks to the corn dog. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> I just can't remember making corn dogs. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> I got one coming up for you, Dale, for a little sea salt action. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> See, I do things. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> A child is hot when it is oil, okay? <time_token_66> <time_token_66> I'm going to sweat out this weave. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> Here's another kind of insider secret. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Because these take really no time at all to fry, <time_token_67> <time_token_68> I don't want to use a cold hot dog because you run the risk of hot batter, cold, <time_token_68> <time_token_68> it's a freaking weenie. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> So go ahead and make sure that your wieners are room temperature. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> We might want to refill a little more batter. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> A little more batter? <time_token_70> <time_token_70> Yeah, more batter. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> So, Dale, I just did these six. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> It's time for you to dip it and stick it. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Wait, is that gymnastics or what is that? <time_token_72> <time_token_72> I think it is a gymnastics. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Look at that beautiful freaking weenie. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> I get compliments all the time. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Now go ahead and dip it in the oil. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Just drop it right down. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> Now here's what you want to do. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> I'll give you the tongs. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> You just want to make sure you're letting it kind of move around. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> You don't want it to kind of hold the stick. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Let's actually hold the stick. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> See how I got so brown so quickly? <time_token_77> <time_token_77> But you still want it a little bit darker. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> By moving it around like that, you're making sure that it's not over one hot spot at any <time_token_79> <time_token_79> given time too long. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> That makes sense. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> If we had a deep though, like a deep fire, you basically would just hold it down. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> So it looks good now. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> I'm going to take it out. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> We actually got a little freaking weenie tail one. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> That one's so cute. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> If you touch his tail, it'll bark. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> I'm pretty sure. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> That's unscientific, but it sounds delicious. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> That sounds delicious. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Oh, it's happy. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> So we just made two really easy, really delicious homemade recipes. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> First, a wonderful savory and tangy homemade ketchup. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> And the second one, delicious homemade Franken weenies. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> So let's do that for our product. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Oh, look at that. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> Beautiful corn dog Franken weenie. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Want to get our Franken weenie on?

<time_token_12> <time_token_13> No, never skin on German roasted potatoes. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Anyway, so that's what I did already. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> And then you cut them nice and thin. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> And it was a quarter inch. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> And it was something like that. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> Now we did that. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> We cut some onions and julienne. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> I know Laura did that already. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> Of course I did. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> She told me she really wanted to do it again, <time_token_19> <time_token_20> but I said, no, don't. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> We have enough, we have plenty of onions. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> We got some bacon, just cut in nice little stripes. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> You can also cut it in little cubes. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> So that's the whole preparation. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> So where we start out, a pan. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> We have a nice hot pan here. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> Put a little oil in it, Laura. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> He's gonna make me do this one, <time_token_25> <time_token_25> but I love potatoes, so this is gonna be easy. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Tell me how much oil. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> For a little less than a quarter inch. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> That's actually perfect. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Now, we're gonna start with the potatoes. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> The potatoes already cut. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> I was grabbing for the onions. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> That's what I thought. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> Yeah, that's what. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> The order is the way we started, potatoes first. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> Because the potatoes take the longest <time_token_31> <time_token_32> to get nice and crispy and cooked. <time_token_32> <time_token_32> We're gonna let it cook just for a little bit now. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> Well, let that cook, but we're gonna get to the pork. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Let's try that. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> We're gonna start to make the Viene Schnitzel. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Now, I have a whole pork loin here already cleaned up. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> When you go to your butcher, you can get them already cut <time_token_37> <time_token_37> in three or four ounce pieces. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> And what I did. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> You pounded it out. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> I pounded two pieces out already, <time_token_39> <time_token_40> but I want you to pound one because that's a fun part. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> I like that. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> What we're gonna use is we're gonna use a Ziploc bag. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Open it up, and now I'm gonna help you with that, <time_token_42> <time_token_42> and then you're gonna pound it. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> We wanna give it a nice whack. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> God, I feel like I'm beating the... <time_token_44> <time_token_44> Hit it, hit it, Laura. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> We can feel it now. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Breading starts out with salt and pepper. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> This is fun. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> And let's start. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> And now the first thing we're gonna do, <time_token_50> <time_token_50> what do you think when we do breading? <time_token_50> <time_token_50> We got three ingredients. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> What do we start with? <time_token_51> <time_token_51> We do dry, wet, dry. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> It's very nice. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> One piece and the flour just very lightly. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Start with this one. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Turn it around, turn it around. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Shake it off a little bit. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> Shake it off. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> A little more, shake it off a little more. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> And now we're gonna put it in the... <time_token_56> <time_token_56> And both sides. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> Now grab some crumbs, put them on top. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> A lot of it. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> And now what works really well <time_token_58> <time_token_59> so the breadcrumbs stick on it, <time_token_59> <time_token_59> you're gonna use their fist <time_token_59> <time_token_60> and you're gonna just press it down. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> Just like this. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> Let's put that right here. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> Okay, we're moving. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Let's come over here. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> Let's put some bacon in there. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> How about that? <time_token_64> <time_token_64> And then it is gonna mix it. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> And you still haven't added the onions yet. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> The onions are gonna be all the way at the end. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> And now it's gonna mix them up. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> And now we're gonna let that cook a little bit. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> Look at that. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> And like medium heat, not too hot <time_token_67> <time_token_67> because you're gonna burn the potatoes. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Like I did. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> And I like them burnt actually. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> Just nice and crispy and dark, right? <time_token_69> <time_token_69> And I like that too. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> All right, I'm gonna get back to this. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> Let's finish with one piece. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> Remember all the recipes are on our website, <time_token_71> <time_token_71> There we go. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> So now the potatoes, the potatoes are almost done. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> So what we're gonna add now, <time_token_73> <time_token_74> we're gonna add some onions. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> How much all? <time_token_74> <time_token_74> No, not just half of it. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Just about half. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> Just a little, that's enough. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> You like that? <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Let it cook a little bit. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> We heated up the pan already <time_token_77> <time_token_78> and I added a good amount of oil. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> Let's put it in. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> Oh, that's perfect. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> Look at that. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> It starts nice bubbling on the side. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> And this is perfect. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> How many minutes on each side? <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Around, I would think around three, four minutes <time_token_83> <time_token_83> on each side. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> And that's it. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Well, let's plate this up. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> All right, wonderful. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> And talk to me about the restaurant. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Now you're open every day. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> We open every day except Monday. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> If you're not gonna do Oktoberfest at home, <time_token_86> <time_token_86> you have to get to the restaurant in Alameda <time_token_86> <time_token_87> and check out his Oktoberfest party. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> I'm gonna show you something. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Are you ready for this?

Today, in your 360 11.5 inch fry pan, we are cooking <time_token_7> <time_token_11> some tasty hash browns. First, preheat your fry pan over medium heat for a couple of minutes. <time_token_13> <time_token_17> Pour a quarter cup of either peanut oil or canola oil into the pan. Let the oil heat <time_token_17> <time_token_21> for a couple of minutes. You'll see a nice shimmer to the oil when it's hot. Test the <time_token_21> <time_token_25> oil by dipping a strand of potato into the fry pan. If it sizzles and bubbles like this, <time_token_25> <time_token_30> the pan is ready. Now add three cups of shredded potatoes that have been thoroughly rinsed, <time_token_30> <time_token_34> drained and patted dry with paper towels. Be sure the potatoes are dry because water <time_token_34> <time_token_39> and hot oil will cause spattering. Press the potatoes down to cover the bottom of the fry <time_token_44> <time_token_50> pan. Season lightly with salt and pepper and cook over medium heat five to six minutes <time_token_50> <time_token_57> depending on your stove top. Now reduce the heat to low and continue cooking for an additional <time_token_57> <time_token_61> five minutes until the potatoes are brown on the bottom. Turn the potatoes over using <time_token_61> <time_token_66> a heat-proof turner. You don't need to flip all the potatoes at once. Just take it section <time_token_66> <time_token_73> by section until they've all been turned. Now pat the potatoes together to make a large <time_token_73> <time_token_78> pancake shape. Cook an additional ten minutes. Place the potatoes on a platter lined with <time_token_78> <time_token_87> paper towels. Taste, re-season if necessary and serve. These are nice and crispy and will <time_token_87> <time_token_91> be perfect with our pancakes and scrambled eggs.

I got a request from Elizabeth. Want to learn how to make <time_token_1> <time_token_2> chicken pot Thai. So I got some rice noodle. This is a dry, very hard rice noodle <time_token_2> <time_token_3> and you soak into like a hot water just from the tap hot water. Not boiling water. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> If you soak in the boiling water or the noodle, see this, they will stick <time_token_4> <time_token_5> together and later on it's hard to cook. So you soak in this noodle with the hot <time_token_5> <time_token_6> warm hot water about I will say 15 minutes. It will separate it like this. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> And this is for one serving. At home I like to do for one serving single <time_token_7> <time_token_8> serving. You just get a nice serving plate and you just put a little bit the <time_token_8> <time_token_9> protein and vegetable and the pasta here so you know that's just for you. I got <time_token_9> <time_token_10> some cooked chicken or you can use rosatory chicken or you can use the <time_token_10> <time_token_11> grilled chicken that you have left over. I got some shorty cut carrot, green onion. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> This is the unsalted peanut and I use it food processor. This is what you get. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> This is for garnish for later on. I got some bean sprout and one egg. So we're <time_token_14> <time_token_14> gonna make the sauce first. I'm gonna show you how to cook. Now we are going <time_token_14> <time_token_15> to make the sauce, pad thai sauce. I got 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar and <time_token_15> <time_token_16> 2 tablespoons of sugar. I just put it in the microwave for a few seconds and we <time_token_16> <time_token_17> stir until the sugar and vinegar dissolve like this. Give a quick taste. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> This is going to be your sweet and balanced taste. Most people will add 3 <time_token_19> <time_token_20> tablespoon sugar and 3 tablespoons of the apple cider, equal amount, but I just <time_token_20> <time_token_21> add 2 tablespoons of this sumi. So I like this way. And about 1 teaspoon of the <time_token_21> <time_token_23> free sauce and the thai hot chili sauce, maybe 1 tablespoon. 2 depends how you <time_token_23> <time_token_24> like it. I like to use some hot chili flakes and some sriracha. Give them more <time_token_24> <time_token_25> flavor. And this is one of the important ingredients for pad thai sauce, tamarind. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Can you see it right here? I got it from Kroger. They have a little one in Kroger <time_token_26> <time_token_28> or the Hellas Market. This is like a fruit. Tastes like plum, very sour. Give <time_token_28> <time_token_30> them a unique citrus. So I'm going to add in some 2 teaspoons. Here we go. And you <time_token_30> <time_token_31> give them a quick taste. The sauce is supposed to be almost like glaze. And the <time_token_31> <time_token_33> sauce is pretty strong flavor. I like it. Nice well-balanced pad thai sauce. And you <time_token_33> <time_token_34> have to respect too many different cultures in Southeast Asia, the regions. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Everybody cook their own pad thai sauce. So we have to respect them. And this is my <time_token_35> <time_token_36> version of the pad thai sauce. And this is like 6-7 ways of the sauce that pad thai <time_token_36> <time_token_36> style can cook. So I'm going to introduce to you. And now we're going to cook. We want to <time_token_36> <time_token_38> make sure the wok is hot. Some cooking oil. That's good. And we're going to cook the <time_token_41> <time_token_42> egg first. And then we're going to stir fry the vegetables first. <time_token_43> <time_token_47> Add some ginger and garlic. Give them a quick stir fry. This is just for one serving. For <time_token_47> <time_token_49> about a minute, after one minute, we're going to add in the noodle. This noodle is not well done <time_token_49> <time_token_51> cooked yet. So we need some time to cook it through. If you cook for like a few people at <time_token_51> <time_token_52> the time, I suggest you can put a pot of the boiling water. And then you can add for the <time_token_52> <time_token_53> serving of the noodle into the pot of the water just boy for maybe one minute. And they will <time_token_53> <time_token_55> soften really quick. So we want to speed up a little bit. Cover up for maybe 15-20 seconds. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> And they will help to get the noodle softened. One quick note. If you cook for a lot of people, <time_token_57> <time_token_58> like this wok, I can cook for four serving. If you cook for eight people, I suggest you use two wok. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Because you want to make sure you can maintain the temperature while you cook it. Very important. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> I can tell you. See, the noodle is softened now, right? And they still kind of stay dry. If your <time_token_61> <time_token_62> ingredients are not dry, that means your wok is not high enough because you need to sear. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> That's Asian cooking. It's all about stir fry and sear. So this is good. Now we're going to add the <time_token_63> <time_token_64> sauce. The sauce you add as much as you want and depends how you like it. So I usually just think <time_token_64> <time_token_66> about cover up like a dressing. See, I did not finish the whole entire sauce. And then I get a <time_token_66> <time_token_67> quick stir. I boil it just to see. I think this is good enough. And the leftover sauce you can use <time_token_67> <time_token_69> it for later. So now it's very critical. A lot of people just serve like this. So the sauce tastes <time_token_69> <time_token_70> like dressing. Sweet and sour watery. Really not a really good full flavor yet. You want to caramelize <time_token_70> <time_token_71> the sauce because we have sugar and all the tamarind and all the good stuff. So what I like to do is I <time_token_71> <time_token_73> want to keep stirring and make sure my wok is hot. If they're not hot, just cover up for a few seconds. <time_token_73> <time_token_76> Here we go. You see the temperature increase and you almost want to stir the noodle until like they <time_token_76> <time_token_77> kind of like stick together again. And I can see the chicken and the egg have the <time_token_77> <time_token_78> caramelization. That's the flavor. You just have to try a few times, you know. Cook a few times. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> You find a good recipe. You just keep trying it until you master the way you like it. <time_token_79> <time_token_81> Oh yeah. I can just tell by looking probably one more minute. Stay with me. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Oh yeah, I like it. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Okay, before you serve, give them a quick try. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> Delicious. So now if you want to have more flavor, you just add a little more sauce at a time. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Do the same thing. As long as you don't burn the noodle, it's fine. Just add a little bit and let <time_token_88> <time_token_89> that stir fry and caramelize. You need that caramelization smell, texture. Voila. Done. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> So we're going to put some bean sprout right here and some lime. Some people like to squeeze <time_token_91> <time_token_93> a piece of lime. And we're just going to sprinkle some peanuts. This is roasted unsalted <time_token_93> <time_token_94> peanuts on the top like that.

<time_token_4> <time_token_6> Rutabaga, parsnip, flour, milk, beef stock, cumin, thyme, bay leaf, curry powder, beef <time_token_6> <time_token_7> mince, or as real people say, ground beef, olive oil, bulli and pear. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> Or shh shh shh shh shh shh shh. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> Mirapra which we've painstakingly chopped ourselves, and tomato based. <time_token_9> <time_token_11> And we have our water boiling so that we can cook our parsnips and our rutabaga and get <time_token_11> <time_token_11> them ready to mash. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> So we'll let that boil for like 10 or 15 minutes and then we'll come back to it. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> Now I'm gonna go fight crime. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Okay, so we've boiled our parsnips and our rutabaga. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> So we are gonna take these and strain them right over here. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> So we'll go ahead and mash these so that we can make the topping for the cottage pie. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Toss these, not easily I'm sure. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> I'm just gonna watch you. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> My fancy colander ain't working out so well now is it. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> So we've got our parsnips and rutabaga. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> So we're gonna add our milk and our cumin. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> Actually the fat and the milk, toast the starch and the root vegetables and mix it smoother. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> So now that we've got our hand mashing done, we're gonna go ahead and use a little mixer <time_token_28> <time_token_28> to get these nice and smooth. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> So we've transferred them into a higher pan so they don't get all over the place. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Oh my god! <time_token_30> <time_token_31> If they're still a little dry, should we add a little more milk?

<time_token_2> <time_token_3> Today's recipe is pierogies. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> These tasty little devils originated in eastern and central Europe. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> We're in no way claiming them to be authentic, but they're nevertheless delicious. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> So let's get started. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> So what I've got here is a large potato that I boiled up. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> And we're going to combine this with half a cup of grated cheddar cheese. <time_token_9> <time_token_9> And of course, you can use your favorite cheese. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> A tablespoon of bacon bits. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> If you want to use real chopped up bacon, that's fine as well. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> A quarter teaspoon of granulated garlic. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Then we're going to throw in a couple of tablespoons of milk. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> A quarter teaspoon of salt. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> And last but not least, a quarter teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> Now I'm just going to grab my potato masher here and mash this up until everything is <time_token_19> <time_token_20> really nicely combined. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Okay now our filling is done, we're going to begin making our pierogi wrappers. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> And I'm going to begin by adding two cups of all purpose flour to a bowl. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Crack in a couple of eggs. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> And two thirds of a cup of lukewarm water. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> I'm just going to grab my spoon here and just kind of mix things up. <time_token_27> <time_token_29> You're probably going to want to change to your hands later just to get a good consistency <time_token_29> <time_token_29> and a good mixture. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> So you're going to work this until you get a nice ball of pierogi dough, something like <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Okay what you want to do now is flour a surface. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> This dough is a little bit on the wet sticky side so you might want to add a generous amount <time_token_34> <time_token_35> of flour and also flour your rolling pin. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Now we're just going to lay the dough on and cut it in half just so we have two workable <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Grab the rolling pin and we're going to roll this out until it's all I'd say somewhere <time_token_39> <time_token_40> in the neighborhood of about an eighth of an inch thick. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Now I'm going to grab a dough cutter here and this is just something I've got kicking <time_token_43> <time_token_44> around in the cupboard and it's perfect, it's about three and a half inches. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> So we're just going to go ahead and cut some circles out here. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Remove the excess dough but of course don't throw it out because you're going to make <time_token_47> <time_token_47> more pierogi wrappers out of this. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Okay so what we're going to do is scoop up about a heaping tablespoon of the mixture. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Put the wrapper into the palm of your hand. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Place the mixture into the center of the wrapper. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Place it down, fold it over and then just kind of seal it shut. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> After that what I'm going to do is just take a fork and kind of push down on it. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> This is going to do a couple of things. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Number one it's going to seal it shut and it's going to make a nice fancy design. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Alright what you want to do now is bring a pot of water to a nice rolling boil. <time_token_65> <time_token_68> Throw the pierogies in and let them cook until they begin to float and this will take somewhere <time_token_68> <time_token_69> in the neighborhood of about, I'd say four minutes. <time_token_69> <time_token_71> Of course you're going to want to do these in batches of about four to five and this <time_token_71> <time_token_71> recipe will give you a total of about twelve pierogies. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> While they're boiling don't forget to click that subscribe button because you don't want <time_token_73> <time_token_73> to miss a video. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> After about four minutes they're nicely cooked so we're just going to set these aside on <time_token_75> <time_token_76> a plate and you're going to repeat this process for the rest of the pierogies. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Lastly what we're going to do is add a bit of olive oil to a preheated pan. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> Put the pierogies in and we're going to fry these over medium high heat. <time_token_80> <time_token_83> I'd say for about two and a half minutes on each side just so they're nicely browned. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> Now they're nicely browned you're ready to serve. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> And there you have it our pierogies and believe me guys these are creamy, cheesy, serve them <time_token_88> <time_token_89> up with some sour cream and they are just out of this world. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Head on over to cookingchair.com for this recipe and many more recipes. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> And don't forget to click subscribe and like our videos.

Today we're making some beautiful <time_token_1> <time_token_4> tomato soup. Now the ingredients cost me eight dollars forty and it serves six so per portion <time_token_4> <time_token_5> it's only going to cost you a dollar and forty cents so let's get started. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> He's got budget meals Monday what you want Wednesday fast food Friday what else could he share <time_token_7> <time_token_9> it's Nicko's Kitchen where satisfying meals are prepared. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> So the first thing that we want to do guys into a large saucepan I'm going to add some <time_token_11> <time_token_12> olive oil. Now the first thing that we're going to add guys I've just got some chopped up <time_token_13> <time_token_13> onion just here I'm just going to add that straight in <time_token_14> <time_token_15> and I've also got some garlic as well I'm just going to add that to the onion. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Now I'm just rounding off the onion and the garlic because we really want to intensify <time_token_16> <time_token_18> those flavors when we make our soup so over a high heat it should only take about a minute and a <time_token_18> <time_token_20> half to get that beautiful brown caramelization happening on that onion. Once you've done that <time_token_20> <time_token_22> I'm going to add in some fresh tomatoes that I've cut up now you could use canned tomatoes if you <time_token_22> <time_token_24> wanted to but I find fresh tomatoes work best for this recipe. Now turning the heat down to <time_token_24> <time_token_25> a medium heat on the stove just stir in those tomatoes onion and garlic together <time_token_26> <time_token_27> and at this stage I'm going to add in some pepper and season with some salt. <time_token_27> <time_token_29> So what you want to do here guys for the next four to five minutes over a medium heat just keep <time_token_29> <time_token_31> stirring around and we want those tomatoes to relax and collapse okay we want those juices to <time_token_31> <time_token_33> ooze out of the tomato and we want them nice and soft. So you can see here our tomatoes have started <time_token_33> <time_token_34> to collapse and now what I'm going to add in is some tomato paste now what the tomato paste does <time_token_34> <time_token_37> is it just gives it that beautiful red color and also a richness in the soup. Now to add the liquid <time_token_37> <time_token_39> to our tomato mixture and I'm going to add in some chicken stock now you could use vegetable stock <time_token_39> <time_token_40> if you wanted to but I do find that the chicken stock gives it a much much better flavor <time_token_40> <time_token_42> and you can see here guys our soup is slowly starting to come together. <time_token_42> <time_token_45> Now the very last thing I'm going to add to our tomato soup is some potatoes okay now what the <time_token_45> <time_token_47> potatoes will do it will give this a beautiful creamy texture. So guys that's all you have to do <time_token_47> <time_token_49> now over a medium to high heat okay we're going to put the lid on the pot and we're going to let <time_token_49> <time_token_52> this cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until those potatoes have gone nice and soft so lid in 15 <time_token_52> <time_token_53> to 20 minutes on a medium to high heat and boy oh boy this is smelling awesome already. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> So guys I've just taken the lid off and check out that color it looks awesome now right at the end <time_token_55> <time_token_57> and this is what brings everything together and makes this taste sensational. I've got some fresh <time_token_57> <time_token_59> basil leaves I'm just going to put them in as they are because we're going to blitz this down but <time_token_59> <time_token_60> just leave the basil leaves in there just let them wilt down for about five minutes more on the <time_token_60> <time_token_63> cooking time. So I've just taken off our soup off the heat and for the next part guys you're going <time_token_63> <time_token_64> to need a hand blitzer just like that now if you don't have one of these you could put this <time_token_64> <time_token_66> in the blender but be very careful because the mixture is very very hot. So what I want you to <time_token_66> <time_token_67> do straight in because we're going to be just creaming together those potatoes because they're <time_token_67> <time_token_69> still whole just very slowly mix it all together just like that and just blitz those potatoes down. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> So that's what you're after guys this beautiful creamy thick tomato soup let's serve this bad boy <time_token_72> <time_token_73> up and just to finish it off guys over the top just a bit of presentation I'm going to finish it <time_token_73> <time_token_76> off with a little bit more of that fresh basil. So guys it looks sensational it smells sensational <time_token_76> <time_token_78> and I tell you what it's going to taste sensational as well so let's get stuck in just look at how <time_token_78> <time_token_80> thick that is guys that's exactly what you're after with a soup so let's get stuck in. <time_token_81> <time_token_84> Beautiful the clean flavors and what I mean by clean it's fresh it's vibrant the basil that <time_token_84> <time_token_87> fresh tomato that is great that is so awesome it's healthy it's cheap and it tastes phenomenal <time_token_87> <time_token_89> guys please give this a go it is awesome all the ingredients are below so check it out you guys <time_token_89> <time_token_91> take care and if you're watching tomorrow we're making chocolate cake on Nico's bakery so make <time_token_91> <time_token_93> sure you check that channel out otherwise I'll see you back here on Wednesday for what you want <time_token_93> <time_token_93> Wednesday so until then take care.

I'm Hidl. I'm Anuja. And today we're making Jana Masala. <time_token_2> <time_token_4> And this is a recipe shared with us by my brother-in-law. And he does a fantastic job with it. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> And my sister refuses to learn how to make it. Because she knows if she learns, he'll stop making it. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> So now she won't have a choice after this video. And here's what you need. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> Two cups of chana, or garbanzo beans, soaked in eight cups of water. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> One bay leaf, one black cardamom, and a two inch piece of cinnamon. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> Salt to taste. One and a half tablespoons oil. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> One eighth teaspoon asafoetida. One 14.5 ounce can of crushed tomatoes. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> Half teaspoon each of chak masala, red chili powder, anardana powder, and dried mango powder. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> One tablespoon chana, or chole masala. Two tea bags. Sliced onions and green chilies, optional for garnishing. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> So for our chana masala recipe, we have a pressure cooker going on high heat right now. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> And we've added our chana into there using the same water that it was soaked in. So that's in there. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> And to this we're going to add in the bay leaf, black cardamom, cinnamon stick, tea bags, and salt. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> And we're going to give it a mix. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> Now the tea bags, for those who have not used tea bags ever in cooking, it gives a really nice, rich, dark color to the chana. <time_token_22> <time_token_24> So we've closed the pressure cooker. We're going to, once the pressure builds up, we're going to let it whistle two or three times, lower the heat, and let it cook for about 20 minutes. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Alright, the pressure cooker, the chanas are done in the pressure cooker. Let's have a look. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Wow. Beautiful color. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> Yeah, the tea bags really, you know, help. So what we're going to do now is just take out the tea bags, because you don't want to eat those. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> Alright, out with those. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> And we have a bowl and just something to scoop out the chana. We're going to separate the chana from the liquid that they're in. <time_token_32> <time_token_32> And don't throw away the liquid, because we are going to use it. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> So a good way to tell if your chana is cooked properly is that you'll notice there's cracks. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> And if it's cracked, you know that it's going to be soft on the inside. And, you know, people have different preferences. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Some people really like the chana, you know, to hold shape. Some people like them all mashed down. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> So it's up to you. If you like, you know, overly cooked chana, then just keep the pressure cooker going on for a little bit longer. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> But this is perfect for us, because it's still going to hold shape, and it's cracking, so we know it's perfectly cooked, too. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> And over here, we have a medium-sized skillet. And you put it on medium heat, actually medium to a little higher than medium. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> And we're going to put in the oil. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Okay, once the oil is hot, we're going to add in the tea, and quickly add in the tomatoes. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> Now, we've used the canned tomatoes. They have a really nice color, and it actually has, you know, a lot of nutrients packed in there. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> But if you want to use fresh tomatoes, that's always a great option, also. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> And we're going to allow this to cook, and basically the oil needs to separate from the tomatoes. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> So we're going to keep it on a little medium-high, but keep an eye on it. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Tomatoes, first of all, they'll burn fast, and second of all, it'll splatter all over. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> So, you know, we have our efforts. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Yes. So we're going to do that, and we'll see you back. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> So we ended up covering our tomatoes, because they were splattering all over the place. <time_token_50> <time_token_52> But they are cooked. You can see the oil is coming out from the sides, and that's the perfect indication that the tomatoes are ready. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Looks good. We're going to add in the dry spices now. <time_token_54> <time_token_56> Chanana sauce, red chili powder, sesame powder, dried mango powder, and anardana powder. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> Anardana is actually pomegranate seeds, so it has a really nice, tangy flavor, and it adds a really, like, a new dimension to the skin. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> We've used store-bought chana masala, and you can buy any brand, and just, you know, just a bit. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> All of them are a little different, but most of them are very good. Right. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> All right. This is done. We're going to add in the chanas, or the chili. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> We have a good mix. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> Okay. And now what we're going to do is we've got sweet-sasted water from the chili that we boiled, <time_token_66> <time_token_67> and we're going to keep adding that a little at a time, and let it just keep cooking. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> So little by little, this liquid is going to get absorbed by the chana, and it's going to make them really flavorful. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> So while that's cooking, we're going to cover it one more time, and it'll help all the flavors incorporate really well. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> All right. Let's have a look. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> We have actually been stirring it in the middle, so it doesn't, you know, burn. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Wow. It's dried up nicely. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> And what I'm going to do is just take the end of your spatula and just press it in a little bit so that, you know, everything just incorporates well. <time_token_75> <time_token_77> And the chana actually absorbs a little bit of the masala, and it's a little bit, it forms a thickish gravy. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Right. And we can go ahead and add a little more liquid. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> One of mine is we're going to repeat this process till all the liquid's gone, and we've reached our desired consistency here. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> And this recipe, of course, it's a drier version, so it's not very gravy-like. <time_token_81> <time_token_83> But the key is that as the liquid gets evaporated, it just concentrates the flavor, and it's so good. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> All right. Cover it again. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Okay. Let's have a look. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Looks very good. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Yes. The color is awesome. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> And we're going to stop at this point. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> Over a little time, it'll get a little drier, because the chanas will keep absorbing the liquid, and, you know, they'll still, even after I turn it off, it'll dry up a little bit more. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> So we're going to keep it like this. <time_token_88> <time_token_90> And when you serve this, you can have some sliced onions or green chilies and even some cilantro or coriander leaves and just garnish the top of it. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> And it'll be delicious. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Yes. And also, this same recipe can be used for if you're having samosa chaat or tikki chaat, you know, just take a tikki and put some on this. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> So thank you, Lord Bhaiya, for this recipe. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Like you have said in your email, I thank you, and I bless you. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> That's what you wanted. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> Bless you.

For an order of 20, I will put in about a tablespoon of baking powder, <time_token_32> <time_token_35> a teaspoon of crushed black pepper and three-quarters of a tablespoon of just regular sea salt and <time_token_35> <time_token_37> just basically coat these wings up. They're not really battered but it basically gives <time_token_37> <time_token_38> them a nice crispness and then I usually just let these sit out for about 10-15 minutes <time_token_38> <time_token_40> so that I'm not throwing them into the hot oil ice cold. We'll just let these sit out <time_token_40> <time_token_41> here for about 10 minutes, get the oil up and I'll show you how to fry these off. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Now what you want to do is take about three cups of cooking oil and you're going to put <time_token_43> <time_token_44> these chicken wings in here on high heat. What you want to do is make sure that while <time_token_44> <time_token_46> you're cooking these chicken wings, stir these around a little bit so they don't stick together, <time_token_46> <time_token_47> they don't stick to the bottom so that they're thoroughly coated in the oil. Once we have <time_token_47> <time_token_49> these up to heat and we've had these sitting out for about 10-15 minutes, they're not ice <time_token_49> <time_token_50> cold and you see that oil really hasn't stopped but we want to make sure that we bring that <time_token_50> <time_token_51> oil back up to heat. Once we have the oil back up to high, then we want to cut it back <time_token_51> <time_token_53> to about medium high so that we thoroughly cook the wings throughout so that you don't <time_token_53> <time_token_55> have rare centers on them. Very, very key yet cooking in a manner such that the exterior <time_token_55> <time_token_56> of the wing is nice and crispy. What we're going to do now is we're going to prep up <time_token_56> <time_token_57> the sauce for the buffalo wings themselves. We start out with about a tablespoon of butter <time_token_57> <time_token_59> and this does make the wings, I don't know, just give them a nice soft taste to them. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Now, I mean there's a lot of different hot sauces you can use. You can use sriracha, <time_token_60> <time_token_62> back at the restaurant people want to say, oh these wings aren't hot enough. I put some <time_token_62> <time_token_63> of this pure cap which has 500 Scoville units in it and I could just about knock somebody <time_token_63> <time_token_64> out into the weeds with this stuff. But we're making this for probably normal guests and what <time_token_64> <time_token_66> I like to use is just Frank's Red Hot. This is just a nice hot sauce and I put in about <time_token_66> <time_token_69> three tablespoons of that into the frog pan here. Now, to that I like to add some vinegar, <time_token_70> <time_token_71> two tablespoons. We want to cook that off so that we get rid of all the acidity in the vinegar. <time_token_71> <time_token_75> And to this mixture as that acidity is coming off of the sauce, we're going to give this just a <time_token_75> <time_token_77> tease of cayenne, just about got all that vinegar off. And then what we want to do is take some good <time_token_77> <time_token_79> oil lines that made a ketchup and I'll put about three tablespoons of that into the sauce. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> Screw that around, something like that. I'll hit it with the wings, <time_token_82> <time_token_87> you can thoroughly coat the wings now with the force. You get your wings thoroughly coated up, <time_token_87> <time_token_89> all you can do then is plate them up. Okay, we've got our buffalo wings all plated up here. We've <time_token_89> <time_token_90> got these served up with some blue cheese dressing. You could also use ranch dressing, <time_token_90> <time_token_91> whatever your taste preference is. We've served them up with the traditional celery and carrot <time_token_91> <time_token_92> sticks and they're now ready to serve. You'd probably want to serve these with a small plate <time_token_92> <time_token_94> so that the people can put the wings onto the plate. Let's take one of these wings out here, <time_token_94> <time_token_97> give it a try, see how spicy it is. Nice crisp wing, not too spicy. I think it's just spot on, <time_token_97> <time_token_98> to tell you the truth. Hey, it's Clean The Ball Chef. Thanks for watching and as always, bon appetit.

I'm MK reporter and I'm here with our <time_token_0> <time_token_1> ambassador Alvin Kwa. Welcome Alvin. Good to see you again. Now tell me, what are we <time_token_1> <time_token_3> cooking today? We're making a seafood laksa, so from scratch. Yum, from scratch. That sounds like really hard work. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> No, this is this is really easy. All my stuff, all my recipes are really easy. It's all about <time_token_4> <time_token_5> getting the right balance, the right ingredients and you're ready to go. Well <time_token_5> <time_token_6> Aussies love our seafood so I'm really looking forward to this, a seafood laksa. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> I won't get in your way. Great. Let's do it. So we're going to start making my <time_token_7> <time_token_8> laksa today. It's a seafood laksa. Let's start making the paste from scratch. So <time_token_8> <time_token_9> we've got some garlic and ginger. So all it goes into the food processor. We've <time_token_9> <time_token_10> got some candle nuts here. Now that's been soaking in water for a bit just to <time_token_10> <time_token_11> soften it a little bit. Now candle nuts are really good for laksas. They give it <time_token_11> <time_token_12> that creaminess into it. Like if you can't find candle nuts, try harder. But if you <time_token_12> <time_token_13> really can't find candle nuts, then you can use macadamias as well. So nice and <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Australian. So we can actually add some, we're going to add some chopped onion. So <time_token_14> <time_token_15> this is just roughly chopped. So they're all just going to go in there. Some small <time_token_15> <time_token_16> birds are chili. So these are, I'm leaving the seeds on because we like <time_token_16> <time_token_17> spicy food. So we're going to check that in. We've got some dried shrimp as well. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> Now dried shrimp, again seafood laksa. Laksa paste itself is actually very, it's <time_token_19> <time_token_20> just an intense seafood paste. So we're going to add the dried shrimp. We're <time_token_20> <time_token_21> going to add some turmeric powder. So this gives it that colour, about a teaspoon. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> We're going to add some lime rind. This gives it that lovely sort of fresh <time_token_22> <time_token_23> citrusy flavour. Now Vietnamese mint, so we need like a good bite. So about a <time_token_23> <time_token_24> tablespoon. Now we're going to add the shrimp paste. Now we're only going to add <time_token_24> <time_token_26> one teaspoon. We're not going to add the whole block. Now this, if you want to, you <time_token_26> <time_token_27> can actually toast them fairly gently on the flame. So that gives it that extra <time_token_27> <time_token_28> sort of toastiness. But you don't have to. We've also got some coriander powder, <time_token_28> <time_token_29> also a teaspoon. We're going to add in, I think that's all. So we're going to put a <time_token_29> <time_token_29> little bit of oil to lubricate it and then we're going to grind it all together <time_token_29> <time_token_30> and that's going to be our paste and then we can start making the laksa. So <time_token_30> <time_token_31> just about a tablespoon. <time_token_32> <time_token_32> Now we're going to start whizzing. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Now we're just going to tip these prawn heads in there. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> So it smells nice and sort of pointy. Now as you can see it slowly changes colour <time_token_36> <time_token_38> to this nice sort of orangey sort of gold sort of prawn oil and that's what <time_token_38> <time_token_39> you want. So there'll be a lot of splattering. So if you're a kid trying this <time_token_39> <time_token_40> at home, do it on the adult supervision. So that's well done with head. Now and <time_token_40> <time_token_41> this is a great way, if you don't eat the heads, this is a great way to actually <time_token_41> <time_token_42> use it. You know, like I saw, we're talking about sustainable eating these <time_token_42> <time_token_42> days and we want to use the beast, you know, from head to toe. So why not use <time_token_42> <time_token_43> the prawn heads as well. So at the pace, <time_token_45> <time_token_46> now that's smelling really good. If you need to add a little bit more oil but <time_token_46> <time_token_47> this is fine for me and once you get that lovely sort of fragrance, you can <time_token_47> <time_token_48> actually start adding your stock. Now the stock that I'm actually using, it's <time_token_48> <time_token_49> actually a combination of chicken stock and fish stock. I love fish stock, it <time_token_49> <time_token_50> actually gives it, again, it's a seafood laksa. So go with, if it's a chicken <time_token_50> <time_token_51> laksa then use all chicken stock but it's a combination so it's a total of <time_token_51> <time_token_53> one litre. So we're going to add them in. So once it starts to come to boil, you <time_token_53> <time_token_54> can actually add the coconut cream. So we'll do that. Now there's variations of <time_token_54> <time_token_55> laksa. So there's like the the health-conscious laksa which everyone <time_token_55> <time_token_57> uses, you know, light cream, you know, like the 70% less fat. Like I love, like <time_token_57> <time_token_58> what's the point of having laksa when it's going to be fat-free? You're not <time_token_58> <time_token_59> going to eat this every day unless you're in Malaysia. Trust me, we eat this <time_token_59> <time_token_60> for breakfast. So we're going to bring that to boil as well and then once that <time_token_60> <time_token_61> comes to boil, we'll start adding all the other ingredients, so the prawns, the fish <time_token_61> <time_token_62> bowls, the tofu puffs, but now is when the balancing sort of starts. So you want to <time_token_62> <time_token_63> taste it now. If you taste it right now, it's going to be fairly, it's going to be <time_token_63> <time_token_64> fairly creamy and it's going to be fairly, you know, kind of raw. So it's not <time_token_64> <time_token_65> ready yet. So this is when you start adding little bits and pieces. So you add <time_token_65> <time_token_67> by splashing a couple of drops of fish sauce and a couple, I mean, you know, about a <time_token_67> <time_token_69> minute of splashing. So we can add a bit of sugar to flavour that and then we're <time_token_69> <time_token_69> going to squeeze some lime juice in, just a bit sitting there. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> So the idea is you want to find a balance. So when you're actually <time_token_71> <time_token_72> flavouring, you kind of need to sort of go, okay, that needs a bit more fish sauce, <time_token_72> <time_token_73> so that needs a bit more salt. Now then we're going to add the prawns in. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Right-o. So once that's in, we're going to add the bowls, fish bowls, and the tofu <time_token_75> <time_token_76> puff as well. So we're ready to plate up. That's sort of nice and percolating away. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> So we've got our lovely bowl of vermicelli here. We're gonna top it with a <time_token_77> <time_token_78> little bit of bean sprouts and then we're gonna start scooping all these <time_token_78> <time_token_80> lovely, look at that. So we want to start with maybe some tofu puff. We'll just put <time_token_80> <time_token_82> it there. So we have some fish bowls as well. A couple of prawns and then we're <time_token_82> <time_token_82> gonna spoon the soup over that. <time_token_83> <time_token_86> Now, then we're gonna top it with a little bit of coriander, a bit of shallots, and if you do want <time_token_86> <time_token_87> for a bit more contrast, we can add a bit more bean sprouts. So there you go. How <time_token_87> <time_token_89> easy is that? Seafood latzah, Alvin style. I followed my nose and look what I found. <time_token_89> <time_token_93> Always ready for the taste.

So I have just got a little bit of olive oil in the <time_token_10> <time_token_12> pan and now I am just kind of grilling these tomatoes in this pan, I want to get the maximum <time_token_12> <time_token_15> flavour out of them. Usually, you will always use tomatoes raw just as is, but I just want <time_token_15> <time_token_17> to add that little added dimension of cooked, slightly charred tomatoes. Yum! <time_token_21> <time_token_23> Okay, so the tomatoes are looking lovely and now I am going to cook the bacon, you can <time_token_23> <time_token_25> do this in the oven, but you know, I am going to do this in the frying pan, it's just easier <time_token_25> <time_token_28> this way, I don't need to put on the oven right now. Okay, so just spread the oil around <time_token_28> <time_token_31> and now it's time to fry up the bacon. I have got very little oil in the pan, because ahh, <time_token_31> <time_token_37> you want to hear that sizzle. If only you could smell this right now. <time_token_38> <time_token_45> So the ones that are nice and crisp, I am just going to put it on this paper towel to <time_token_45> <time_token_49> drain. It's a lot of fat in that pan, but it's also flavour, fat is flavour. Now all <time_token_49> <time_token_52> we have to do is just put together this sandwich, cut some mayo here. You don't need too much, <time_token_52> <time_token_54> I am just going to spread this on the bread and what I really like adding to it is just <time_token_54> <time_token_57> a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Otherwise, it's just going to overpower all the other <time_token_57> <time_token_61> flavours of the bacon especially. This way it just compliments the flavour. Okay, so <time_token_61> <time_token_63> now spread this on the bread and you know what makes all the difference when you are <time_token_63> <time_token_66> making a sandwich is the bread that you have got. Try to get the freshest possible bread <time_token_67> <time_token_69> and you know I am making it as is if you like. You can toast this bread, you can grill it, <time_token_69> <time_token_72> it's nice any which way. It's just such a classic sandwich. Now the first layer is of <time_token_72> <time_token_78> lettuce. I always like to leave the stalk out. Now put the tomatoes and that's it. You <time_token_78> <time_token_81> know this is just as simple as that. There's not too much going on here, but just these <time_token_81> <time_token_83> few ingredients are going to give us so much flavour and at this point just sprinkle on <time_token_83> <time_token_92> some salt and pepper. Now I am going to put the bacon. This is a bit enough for me. And <time_token_92> <time_token_93> that is your BLT sandwich to go.

should know that we moved our garden from Seattle <time_token_2> <time_token_2> down to Portland. <time_token_2> <time_token_4> And we still have our chickens, and we'll still be talking about how to grow food and <time_token_4> <time_token_4> cook it in the kitchen. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> So today we're going to talk about bok choy, which looks like it would be hard to grow, <time_token_6> <time_token_6> but it's actually really easy. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> And if I recall, it's not that hard to cook. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> No, it cooks up super fast, and we're going to show you how to make udon soup with bok <time_token_9> <time_token_9> It only takes about 15 minutes. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> I'm going to plant some bok choy by seed. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> You can also grow them by starts, but seeds are less expensive, and it grows really well <time_token_15> <time_token_16> and quickly from seed. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> When you're working with small seeds, not only do you want to have soil that's finely <time_token_18> <time_token_20> worked, but you also want to make sure that you're not going to cover them up too much <time_token_21> <time_token_23> And then I'm going to take a pinch of the seed and just try and sow it in a row, spacing <time_token_23> <time_token_25> the seeds as evenly as I can, you know, aiming for about an inch apart. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> It's a good idea with really small seed, and this works well with basil seed, carrot seed, <time_token_27> <time_token_30> and you see that small water it in with a stream from a watering can, not from your hose. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Hoses have too strong of a stream of water, and they'll wash your seeds away. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> Now, you can cover them up with garden soil, but I like to use some potting soil because <time_token_34> <time_token_36> I know that it's weed-free, and it's a slightly different color from my garden soil, so it <time_token_36> <time_token_37> makes it easy for me to remember where I've sown seed. <time_token_37> <time_token_40> Then I go through and tap the soil with my hand, and that's just so there's good soil <time_token_40> <time_token_40> to seed contact, which is important for germination. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> And then you go back over with the water one more time just to make sure that it's all <time_token_43> <time_token_45> So, I have some pok choy that I grew from starts growing underneath what's called a <time_token_45> <time_token_46> hoop house, and a hoop house is basically a really simple greenhouse. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> So underneath here, I have some broccoli growing, some radishes, and then these purple <time_token_48> <time_token_51> You just want to take a sharp knife and slide it just under the soil line and sever the <time_token_51> <time_token_51> plant from its roots. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> So it's real simple. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Okay, well, I've got the hoop house all covered back up, so I'm going to head inside and make <time_token_54> <time_token_55> We make udon soup a lot during the week because it's really fast and easy. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> So I've got four cups of broth here, and you can use chicken broth or vegetable broth. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> And I'm just going to bring it up to a boil, and once I bring it up to a boil, I'll add <time_token_59> <time_token_60> in the noodles. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> And you can just get udon noodles at the grocery store. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> They sell them frozen or they're in the refrigerator case too. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> Put about two tablespoons of olive oil in the pan, and I've heated it up over medium-high <time_token_64> <time_token_66> And I'm going to put two chopped garlic cloves into the olive oil, and just give them a little <time_token_66> <time_token_67> stir and let them saute until they're fragrant. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> And then I'm going to add in the peppers. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> So I've got the greens. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> They have still a little bit of water clean to their leaves, and that's nice. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> It just helps them wilt a little bit. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> You just give the greens a stir so that they're coated with the olive oil. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> Once the greens have wilted down to kind of your desired consistency, you can just <time_token_76> <time_token_77> turn off the heat and set them aside until the rest of the soup's ready. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> I'm just going to divide the greens between the two bowls. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> I'm going to put the noodles between the bowls too. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> So I'm just going to scoop out about half the noodles and some broth.

And I usually use <time_token_4> <time_token_6> two minced and two chopped just to get a variety of clams. You're going to need two <time_token_6> <time_token_7> pots to make this soup and the first pot you're going to add all your veggies in <time_token_7> <time_token_9> and you're going to open up your cans of clams and pour in their juice. And you <time_token_9> <time_token_10> might think at first that that's a not enough juice from the four cans but I <time_token_10> <time_token_12> promise you it will be. Once your vegetables start cooking they'll let off <time_token_12> <time_token_14> their juices and you'll have plenty. So you can use frozen potatoes and it works <time_token_14> <time_token_15> really good in this chowder but not at this point and I'll show you later when <time_token_15> <time_token_17> you can add the frozen potatoes in. And you're gonna let these simmer until the <time_token_17> <time_token_18> potatoes are tender. Now let's grab our second pot to make the chowder. You will <time_token_18> <time_token_20> need a half cup of butter and I usually chop it up to put it in the pot just so <time_token_20> <time_token_21> it'll melt faster. You will need a quart of half and half and then four cups of <time_token_21> <time_token_23> milk. You can use whole milk but we have skim in our house so skim works fine. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> This soup still thickens up really well so don't worry about that. And then <time_token_25> <time_token_27> you'll need a cup of cornstarch. I know I add it in when all my milk is still <time_token_27> <time_token_28> very cold that way I don't get lumps from the cold cornstarch. Okay you will <time_token_28> <time_token_30> need three teaspoons of salt and black pepper. I just dust the top of it I don't <time_token_30> <time_token_32> measure it at all. And then you'll need one teaspoon of sugar. And then you're <time_token_32> <time_token_33> gonna whisk that up again and you're gonna keep whisking until it thickens <time_token_33> <time_token_34> up. And you're not gonna want to ignore the stove too much because you will <time_token_34> <time_token_35> scorch the bottom of your pan. I used to do that a lot when I first started <time_token_35> <time_token_37> cooking this when I was in college. You don't have to consistently stir but <time_token_37> <time_token_39> stir it quite often and it'll thicken up on you. Once your veggies are done you're <time_token_39> <time_token_40> gonna add them to your cream mixture. And this is when you can add your frozen <time_token_40> <time_token_42> potatoes in. It'll just take a little bit longer to heat through. And then you're <time_token_42> <time_token_44> gonna add your clams. So it doesn't take long for the clams to cook you just are <time_token_44> <time_token_45> heating them through basically. You do use frozen potatoes you might want to <time_token_45> <time_token_47> use your whole milk instead of the skim milk to help thicken it. But it works <time_token_47> <time_token_48> really good I've done it. And then I just taste test it with a plastic fork <time_token_48> <time_token_49> because for some reason a metal fork just makes the chowder seem saltier to <time_token_49> <time_token_51> me. I don't know I'm weird. So yeah and it's done. You're basically just warming <time_token_51> <time_token_52> your clams and your chowder is done. It's super fast you guys. Really quick. <time_token_52> <time_token_54> And then we'll just plate up and chow down. And I promise you you will <time_token_54> <time_token_56> absolutely love this chowder. It's addicting. It makes you really full. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> This batch is just a one batch and it feeds our family but if we are gonna have <time_token_58> <time_token_59> company we usually double it and it makes a lot of soup. But serve it up with <time_token_59> <time_token_61> your favorite rolls and you will be a happy camper. Seriously.

Now obviously it's a checkered <time_token_40> <time_token_40> pie and what the checkered do they eat sheep so we're going to have lamb but if you're going to <time_token_40> <time_token_42> have a cottage pie you'd have a big bit of olive oil in the pan like that and then I've got 500 <time_token_42> <time_token_43> grams of lamb mince here. Now I just need to break it up in the pan <time_token_44> <time_token_44> and we've sort of browned it off to take all that rawness out of it as well. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> Right I'm just going to season it with a bit of salt <time_token_46> <time_token_46> a bit of pepper <time_token_47> <time_token_47> and while it's browning off I'm just going to take out my porcini mushrooms which have been <time_token_47> <time_token_49> soaking now for about 10 minutes nice and soft. Right so now the meat's cooked and we've got <time_token_49> <time_token_50> that rawness out of it I'm going to add some marsala wine into it and then our porcini mushrooms <time_token_50> <time_token_52> which I'm going to chop up. These smell absolutely intoxicating they've got real <time_token_52> <time_token_52> woody natural smells to them and they'll add a real richness to the sauce <time_token_53> <time_token_54> so that's them chopped. Add them into the pan as well <time_token_54> <time_token_54> give it a stir <time_token_55> <time_token_55> and then we'll put back our vegetables <time_token_56> <time_token_57> and this this is where it starts to get a little bit more quirky. So <time_token_58> <time_token_59> funky ingredient number one ketchup really really good for the flavor so give it a really <time_token_59> <time_token_60> good squeeze like that. Funky ingredient number two baked beans couldn't get more traditional <time_token_60> <time_token_61> with baked beans might seem a bit weird but uh other recipes that I use tomatoes chopped tomatoes <time_token_61> <time_token_62> but baked beans just it has something else trust me when you have it you'll see what I'm talking <time_token_62> <time_token_63> about. Next ingredient some frozen peas check out the colors looks absolutely gorgeous then <time_token_63> <time_token_64> we're going to season it a little bit more a bit more salt a bit more pepper <time_token_65> <time_token_66> and then some mustard sauce another great ingredient really good for seasoning it <time_token_66> <time_token_67> then give it a stir <time_token_68> <time_token_68> and then all you need to do is let it bubble away put it on a low heat leave it there for <time_token_68> <time_token_69> at least 20 minutes maybe half an hour almost there <time_token_70> <time_token_70> oh yeah one thing I forgot is that we need to put a bit of our <time_token_70> <time_token_72> mushroom water from the Pachini mushrooms into it so just put a couple of good glugs three in there <time_token_73> <time_token_74> okay it's definitely hot enough when the seasoning is good as well <time_token_74> <time_token_75> oh so we can make it up now okay and then we're going to put in half our meat <time_token_75> <time_token_76> into here and if I want to keep the rest for another time I can just freeze it no problem <time_token_77> <time_token_78> and then on top of the meat we're going to put a mashed potato if you made it earlier <time_token_78> <time_token_78> okay now I'm going to put a big blob of it come check this out into the middle <time_token_79> <time_token_80> then we're just going to spread it to the sides now it matches this creamy if you want to be <time_token_80> <time_token_81> really pretentious about it you could call it pong rusini but I just call it creamy mash <time_token_81> <time_token_82> now spread it all to the sides and once you've covered the meat which I will have done with <time_token_82> <time_token_83> another spoonful like so <time_token_84> <time_token_85> see check it out doesn't need to be too delicate then next thing I'm going to do is grate some <time_token_85> <time_token_86> cheese over it now I have got some mature cheddar which is perfect for it absolutely perfect it's <time_token_86> <time_token_87> exactly what you want and once you've covered all of it with a really thick layer of cheese <time_token_88> <time_token_89> then we're just going to stick it under a really hot grill for a couple minutes into its brown block <time_token_89> <time_token_90> the best thing about this dish is that you don't need to have it with anything it's got <time_token_90> <time_token_91> everything you want right inside it and to serve what we need to do is just stick it to the middle <time_token_91> <time_token_92> with a nice white plate come check this out really nice golden color on top which is exactly <time_token_92> <time_token_93> how you want it and then just put a big healthy spoonful onto your plate like so get a little bit <time_token_94> <time_token_96> sprig of thyme just a garnish a little bit of pepper and there you have it no nonsense <time_token_96> <time_token_97>

<time_token_4> This is another recipe I'm going to do today. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> It's grilled bratwurst with beer, butter, and onions, and I've added a little garlic <time_token_6> <time_token_6> to this one, too. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> I do it a little different than most folks. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> I don't like the idea of simmering my brats in beer. <time_token_8> <time_token_10> Me, you're making kind of bratwurst soup that you're not going to eat. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> I like to do it a little different. <time_token_11> <time_token_13> The way I start out is with the butter in the pan on my grill, and then I add the onions. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Three big onions for a pan full of brats, because they're going to cook way down. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Today, I'm adding a little bit of garlic, too. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> You're not going to hurt anything. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Probably not mandatory, but I like doing that. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> I'm going to let these cook for a little while in the butter, because they're going to take <time_token_22> <time_token_22> a little bit longer than the bratwurst. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> It's been about 15 minutes now. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> I stirred these onions a couple of times. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> They're getting pretty softened up now, looking good. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> I'm going to add this Guinness to them. <time_token_27> <time_token_29> You can use lighter beer if you want, but the dark beer works out pretty well. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> It gives a nice dramatic entrance. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> But you use what you've got laying around. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> I usually look in the back of the fridge and find a beer that I never got around to drinking <time_token_33> <time_token_34> and put that one in there. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> But the Guinness gives it a nice deep flavor. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> It's a good way to go with the bratwurst. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> So I'll stir that back up, and now I'll put the bratwurst on. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> I'm putting these brats on. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> I'm going to cook them, but I'm not that worried about getting them done inside, because <time_token_42> <time_token_43> I'm going to... <time_token_43> <time_token_43> What am I going to do? <time_token_43> <time_token_45> I'm going to brown these bratwurst up now, and then I'm going to take them and drop them <time_token_45> <time_token_46> into the bath there with the beer and the onions and everything. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> I'll be hot by that. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> So as they get colored up and looking good, I'm not that worried about them being completely <time_token_48> <time_token_49> done on the inside, because they're going to finish cooking in there. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> We'll be right back. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> Okay, these have been cooking for a while. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> It's probably been about 10, 15 minutes. <time_token_52> <time_token_54> As you can see, I've got some of them already in here in the bath with the onions and the <time_token_54> <time_token_55> You put them in as they're ready. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> They don't all get done at the same time. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> These last few will go in now. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> They're looking pretty good. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> And again, you don't have to worry so much about them getting all done. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Push them down in. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> If they're not done quite on the inside yet, that's okay, because I'm going to cook them <time_token_60> <time_token_61> a little bit more. <time_token_61> <time_token_65> I'm going to cover them with foil and close the lid, and then I'm going to let them cook <time_token_65> <time_token_67> for about 20 minutes with the foil on, and then I'm going to take the foil off, because <time_token_67> <time_token_68> I want those onions and beer to reduce down. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> So when I get done, I've got the brats laying in there with sort of a creamy onion-beer <time_token_70> <time_token_71> We'll see them in a few minutes. <time_token_71> <time_token_73> All right, then I cooked them for about 20 minutes with the foil on, and then I took <time_token_73> <time_token_74> the foil off. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> And it's been about another 15 or 20, and you see how they're all kind of rendered down <time_token_76> <time_token_76> now and the onions are all creamed out. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> Those brats are soaking in that beer and onions and garlic, beautiful. <time_token_78> <time_token_82> Serve them up, really pretty easy serving, just a bun, potato chips, my White Sox Comiskey <time_token_82> <time_token_84> Park plate, and they honor a baseball, you know, bratwurst and baseball kind of goes <time_token_84> <time_token_85> It grabs a little bit of these onions out of the pan. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> They're cooked on pretty hard, but it makes for a nice plate. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> If you like to put mustard on them, go ahead. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> It's not really my thing, so I'm going to eat mine just like this. <time_token_89>

Today I'm going to show you how to make simple <time_token_3> <time_token_5> plasticers. Here's everything you will need. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> Here is the ingredients overview. First, we have one pound of brown pork, half a cabbage, <time_token_7> <time_token_9> four stalks of green onions, dumpling wrappers, two tablespoons of soy sauce, two tablespoons <time_token_9> <time_token_10> of sesame oil, one tablespoon of salt, and a cup of water to use as adhesive on the <time_token_10> <time_token_12> dumpling wrappers. We also use a dumpling mold which makes folding the potstickers very <time_token_12> <time_token_13> easy and saves you a lot of time. So let's go ahead and get started! <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Mince half a cabbage for a pound of ground pork. You can add more or less for yours. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> It all depends on how much you would like in your potstickers mix. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Next is the green onions. They are faster to cut by slicing them in half, lining them <time_token_18> <time_token_19> back up together and slicing from there. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> Now we will go ahead and prepare the ground pork. Add the minced onions and cabbage, then <time_token_22> <time_token_24> two tablespoons of soy sauce, two tablespoons of sesame oil, and one tablespoon of salt. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Then we can go ahead and start mixing them all together. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> There's plenty of vegetable choices to add into your potstickers. Our favorites are carrots <time_token_30> <time_token_30> and shiitake mushrooms. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> To prepare the potstickers, put about one tablespoon of ground pork mix into the center <time_token_34> <time_token_34> of the potsticker wrapper. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Now to shape the potstickers, place the potsticker wrapper into the dumpling mold and use the <time_token_35> <time_token_37> water to adhere the edges. Just dab the edges with a small amount of water with your fingers. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> Once you're done, press the mold firmly in half to make sure it sticks. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> And voila, a perfectly shaped potsticker. <time_token_43> <time_token_46> I like to have friends and family over to fold the potsticker and have fun together. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> And there you have it, a great batch of perfectly shaped potstickers. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Now to cook the potstickers. <time_token_52> <time_token_54> Add about one tablespoon of vegetable oil into a non-stick pan and spread it out through <time_token_57> <time_token_59> Lay in the potstickers to fill the pan and let them cook until they turn a nice golden <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Once they're done, flip them over and brown the other side as well. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> Once both sides are brown, pour enough water into the pan and cover it up to steam them <time_token_65> <time_token_65> and make sure they're all cooked. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Turn the heat down to medium heat and cook for about three to five minutes or until the <time_token_70> <time_token_71> And now they're done, yummy, crispy and plump potstickers. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Impress your guests by arranging them on your favorite dinnerware alongside some fun floral <time_token_73> <time_token_74> shaped carrots and on top of some extra slices of cabbage. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> You can also make a simple dipping sauce by combining sesame oil with soy sauce. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> Hope you enjoyed watching how to make simple potstickers with me. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> Please subscribe for more videos and recipes and visit our website at mrslainskitchen.com. <time_token_86> <time_token_89> So first you would need to cut the Chinese cabbage. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> See, this is why we go through it.

I'm Betty. Welcome to Betty's Kitchen. Today we're making a bacon, lettuce and tomato <time_token_3> <time_token_6> sandwich or a BLT. Some of you've been asking for sandwiches for the summer and you say <time_token_6> <time_token_8> you don't care if they're plain or substantial or just any kind of something that is a different <time_token_8> <time_token_11> idea for you. So we're going to do something very basic today and that's make the bacon, <time_token_11> <time_token_14> lettuce and tomato sandwich. And I have chosen some white bread. This is hearty white bread. <time_token_14> <time_token_17> Choose any bread that you like if you like a whole wheat or rye, pumpernickel or any of those. <time_token_17> <time_token_20> Just go ahead and toast it. I just use a toaster so I didn't add any extra butter. I didn't heat <time_token_20> <time_token_22> up the oven. I just toasted it in my toaster. So now we need to spread for it and I'm just <time_token_22> <time_token_25> using the simplest of all, mayonnaise. This is mayonnaise free so that will save us all <time_token_25> <time_token_28> on fat calories and I'm just going to drop that along there so I can dip back into my jar and <time_token_28> <time_token_31> get some more and then I'll spread it. So we're just spreading one side of one of the pieces of <time_token_31> <time_token_35> bread with mayonnaise. And if you prefer miracle whip, that's fine. If you would prefer sandwich <time_token_35> <time_token_37> spread which has some pickles and other things in it, gives it a little more flavor, you might <time_token_37> <time_token_39> want to do that. But we're finished with our mayonnaise. Now we just need our bacon, lettuce <time_token_39> <time_token_42> and tomato. I always keep bacon in my freezer. If you'll keep that there, then there are so many <time_token_42> <time_token_44> dishes you can make and just put that in the microwave for like one minute, depending on how <time_token_44> <time_token_46> much you have it cooked, and you'll have nice crisp bacon like this. So I have crisp this up <time_token_46> <time_token_49> and I'm just going to make sure I get these pieces separated so that they will kind of lie <time_token_49> <time_token_53> flat on here. They don't have to be perfect. Just some way get about three slices worth on <time_token_53> <time_token_55> there. Two and a half fits perfectly, but I'll put that over on anyway. So we've got plenty of <time_token_55> <time_token_57> bacon on and now we need some lettuce and tomato. I'd rather put the tomato in the middle. I think <time_token_57> <time_token_59> it will just hang on a little better. I had some sliced tomatoes I was using for something else <time_token_59> <time_token_62> and this is all I have left, but that's fine. You can put one nice big tomato slice or two small <time_token_62> <time_token_65> slices will do great and then get some lettuce. This is iceberg lettuce. Get some lettuce pieces <time_token_65> <time_token_69> that will leaves that will lie flat and you want those kind of outer leaves that aren't too curly <time_token_69> <time_token_71> because inside they are crunchy and curly and they don't want to lie flat and that really prevents <time_token_71> <time_token_74> you from making a nice flat sandwich. Just a little bit more here and then put the lid on it. <time_token_74> <time_token_77> It's that easy. Once you get it done then you can slice it. If you want to slice corner to corner <time_token_77> <time_token_79> that's fine. Straight down the middle like this is fine. Let's just do kind of halfway diagonally. <time_token_79> <time_token_82> So it's a diagonal but not actually from the corners. So I'll come back and put this on a <time_token_82> <time_token_84> plate and show you what it looks like then. So this is what our BLT looks like when we're <time_token_84> <time_token_86> finished and you can do any variation on this that you like. I'm just trying to do the basic <time_token_86> <time_token_88> and show you a little bit of a come to me. We put a few unsalted pretzels here and a few <time_token_88> <time_token_92> olives just to give it some color and flavor to go along with the nice BLT and it's very <time_token_92> <time_token_94> manageable. When you pick it up you can just bite into that and it's not going to fall apart on you <time_token_94> <time_token_96> although a little bit fell apart when I tried to take it up. So I hope you enjoy that sandwich.

for one of <time_token_4> <time_token_5> Italy's most classic soups, it is Pasta Fagioli. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> Some people call it Pasta Fazool, Pasta Fagioli, same thing. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> Now different parts of Italy have their own way of making it, this is the way I make <time_token_7> <time_token_8> it, this is the way my mother makes it, all the women in my family, this is how we make <time_token_8> <time_token_8> So here's what you're going to need. <time_token_8> <time_token_10> You're going to need 3 cans, 3 15 oz cans of cannellini beans that are already rinsed <time_token_10> <time_token_11> You're going to need some celery, some onions, some tomato, crushed tomatoes, tomato puree, <time_token_11> <time_token_12> whatever you have on hand, some shortcut pasta, couple cloves of garlic and you're also going <time_token_12> <time_token_13> to need some extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper, and just a couple fresh basil <time_token_13> <time_token_14> leaves at the end to just really bring out the wonderful flavors of this magnificent <time_token_14> <time_token_15> sort of one pot, wonder of a meal. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> Now let's go to the stove and start cooking. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> I have a big pan, preheating here with 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> I'm going to add my onions and my celery, I'm going to let that saute for a few minutes. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> I really want to bring out all the wonderful flavors and I don't want these to become <time_token_20> <time_token_20> caramelized, I just want them to get tender. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Now this is the way, the pasta pajole, this is the way we make it in Naples. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> So we don't use pancetta, we don't use speck, we don't use any kind of meat in it. <time_token_22> <time_token_24> Now if you go to different parts of Italy, northern people usually put pancetta in theirs, <time_token_24> <time_token_25> And also you'll find that some people, they swear by just making it red, which means a <time_token_25> <time_token_25> lot of sauce, it's going to really be red. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Some people think that it should never be red, it should be just white. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Ours just, it's kind of in between, it's like a pink, it has a pink hue to it. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> It's not red, it's not white, but it's just delicious, it's full of flavor and it is so <time_token_29> <time_token_29> inexpensive to make. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> This used to be called poor people food because, I mean, what's cheaper than pasta and beans, <time_token_30> <time_token_32> But it's not, I think it's one of the, one of these, one of the meals where it just brings <time_token_32> <time_token_33> you, brings your family together, it's comforting, it's filling, and it's delicious. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> So we're going to cook these medium heat for about four to five minutes, you just want <time_token_34> <time_token_35> them to start cooking down, but not caramelized, not brown. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> My onions and celery have been cooking for about five minutes and as you can see, they're <time_token_36> <time_token_37> not brown, but they are softened and all their beautiful flavors coming out and the aroma <time_token_37> <time_token_38> is just wonderful. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> So now I'm going to add my two cloves of garlic that I'm not chopping or sauteing <time_token_39> <time_token_40> it for very long because I want mild flavor of the garlic, I don't want a strong flavor. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> So now I'm going to add my beans, they're beautiful, give these a wonderful little toss, <time_token_42> <time_token_42> just like so. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> This was a request, so I'm extra thrilled to be able to share it with you. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> It's going to be wonderful, wait until you see how wonderful it makes you have smell. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Now we're going to add some water, not adding chicken stock, I'm not adding vegetable stock, <time_token_46> <time_token_47> I'm adding regular water because this is just the way we make it and that's just the way <time_token_47> <time_token_47> I want to do it. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> I do not want to set my mother and my grandmother here. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> There we go. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Now we're going to add in our tomato paste or tomato puree or whatever you have on hand, <time_token_50> <time_token_52> I just happen to have some tomato puree but, and as you can see it looks red but it's <time_token_52> <time_token_53> not, it's actually pink and once it starts to cook down and you add pasta, you can really <time_token_53> <time_token_53> get nice and thick and delicious. <time_token_54> <time_token_56> Okay, medium heat, lid on, 45 minutes, check on it every 20 minutes or so to make sure <time_token_56> <time_token_57> nothing's sticking and it's going to make your house smell delicious and then we're <time_token_57> <time_token_57> going to season it, add the pasta and you're going to have a wonderful wont pot meal that <time_token_57> <time_token_58> you're going to be thankful for. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> My soup's been cooking for 45 minutes and it's just as it should be, as you can see <time_token_60> <time_token_61> it's thickened really well, this is going to be a really nice thick sort of almost like <time_token_61> <time_token_62> a stew but it's just really nice and delicious. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> I'm going to add my short cut pasta, I'm using ditalini, you can use any kind of short cut <time_token_63> <time_token_64> pasta, at this point you want to let the lid off and we're going to season it. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> As always, I start with the pepper and I do not know why, I just do, just a little bit <time_token_66> <time_token_68> of pepper, you want to season it well, okay, now like I said I used just some canned beans <time_token_68> <time_token_69> just because it's a little quicker and a little easier than to use the dry beans otherwise <time_token_69> <time_token_70> you'd have to soak them for a while and you'd have to boil them for 3 hours, this is too <time_token_70> <time_token_71> So within about an hour you have this delicious, hearty, wont pot meal and it's so comforting <time_token_71> <time_token_72> and delicious and like I said it's easy, easy and cheap, perfect. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> So let this go for another 10 minutes because you want the pasta to cook well and then we <time_token_73> <time_token_73> can set it up. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> My soup is ready, perfect, I'm just going to put a few basil leaves in there, not much <time_token_75> <time_token_76> because I don't want it to be, I just really like that aroma, I want it to be overpowering. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> Oh it's perfect, look at that, it's thick, it's delicious, it's affordable and you don't <time_token_78> <time_token_80> need anything else with this, well except I do think that it is necessary to have a <time_token_80> <time_token_81> very big chunk of crusty Italian bread, it is necessary in my book, let me clean my plate <time_token_81> <time_token_83> up a little, because you always eat with your eyes first, a little basil right over <time_token_83> <time_token_84> the side like so, look at that, it's one of the most perfect pasta fizzles you've ever <time_token_85> <time_token_88> Let me just get a tiny taste, just like I remember as a kid, it's so delicious, it's <time_token_88> <time_token_89> so full of flavor, it's thick, it's soft, it's smooth, it's not overpowering with anything, <time_token_90> <time_token_91> I hope you make this recipe, like I said, super easy, super affordable, you need nothing <time_token_91> <time_token_92> else with this for dinner, it's a blast to make because like you've seen it, I mean it <time_token_92> <time_token_93> takes no time at all, within one hour if you're not doing anything to it, five minute prep <time_token_93> <time_token_93> work, you're done, you're good to go and it is really a delicious dish. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> To get this recipe, check out my website www.laurainthekitchen.com, I'll see you guys next time, bye bye. <time_token_95>

I have no idea why this noodle dish is named after Singapore as our <time_token_5> <time_token_7> Singaporean friends have told us that it is nothing to do with Singapore but what <time_token_7> <time_token_10> I do know is that it tastes good and it's very easy to make. We have only used <time_token_10> <time_token_12> shrimp but often people add chicken or pork. You could also experiment with <time_token_12> <time_token_15> other vegetables and a mild curry powder if you don't want the dish to be too hot. <time_token_15> <time_token_18> On screen now the ingredients. For full details check out our blog post. I'll <time_token_18> <time_token_20> link to that in the description box just below this video. Okay so let's get <time_token_20> <time_token_24> started. First place 150 grams of rice vermicelli noodles into a bowl with <time_token_24> <time_token_27> cool water and leave them to soak for about 15 minutes. Whilst the noodles are <time_token_27> <time_token_30> soaking beat one egg and then heat one tablespoon of cooking oil in a wok on a <time_token_30> <time_token_32> high heat and once the wok is hot add half a chopped onion and a quarter sliced <time_token_32> <time_token_35> red bell pepper to the wok and stir-fry them for about 90 seconds and then just <time_token_35> <time_token_40> set them aside. Now heat one tablespoon of cooking oil in the wok on a high heat <time_token_40> <time_token_43> and when the wok is hot just fry 125 grams of shrimp for a couple of minutes <time_token_43> <time_token_46> until the shrimp are pink and cooked and then set them aside with the onions and <time_token_46> <time_token_49> peppers that we fried earlier. Next heat one and a half tablespoons of cooking oil <time_token_49> <time_token_51> in a wok this time on a medium heat and ensure that the oil coats the wok <time_token_51> <time_token_54> completely. Once the wok is hot pour in the egg that we beat earlier and just <time_token_54> <time_token_56> swirl it around the wok in a circular motion so that the egg covers the wok <time_token_56> <time_token_60> and then just cook the omelette until it's light brown on both sides and then <time_token_60> <time_token_63> thinly slice it as shown here and set aside. Finally pour the remainder of the <time_token_63> <time_token_65> cooking oil into the wok, heat on a high heat and then add two teaspoons of hot <time_token_65> <time_token_68> curry powder briefly stir-fry the curry powder in the cooking oil then drain the <time_token_68> <time_token_71> 150 grams of rice vermicelli noodles that we were soaking and add them to <time_token_71> <time_token_73> the wok. Mix the noodles in with the curry powder and then add all of the <time_token_73> <time_token_77> other ingredients that we prepared earlier along with one and a half <time_token_77> <time_token_81> tablespoons of soy sauce, half a tablespoon of sesame oil and one cup of <time_token_81> <time_token_84> bean sprouts. Mix everything together thoroughly whilst cooking for a final <time_token_84> <time_token_87> one to two minutes, garnish with coriander then serve and enjoy.

Today I'm going to show you how to make a grilled chicken Caesar salad from scratch. <time_token_1> <time_token_3> So some of my favorite recipes are suggestions that come from all of you. So this recipe is <time_token_3> <time_token_5> going out to Bubble Puff 109. You wanted to know how to make a classic Caesar and I'm going to <time_token_5> <time_token_7> show you how to do it. So the first thing we're going to do is create the marinade for our chicken. <time_token_7> <time_token_10> In a dish you're going to combine some olive oil, some garlic, lemon zest, Italian seasoning, <time_token_10> <time_token_13> and salt and pepper. Whisk that all up just until combined and then you're going to add <time_token_13> <time_token_15> your boneless skinless chicken breasts. Make sure it's marinated on all sides so that the chicken <time_token_15> <time_token_16> is well coated. You're then going to cover and pop in the fridge and then meanwhile we're going <time_token_16> <time_token_19> to create our croutons. Now if you ask me, the croutons are the mark of any great Caesar salad. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> So it definitely pays to make them from scratch. Don't go out and buy the croutons thinking you're <time_token_20> <time_token_22> going to save a step because it will not be as good. And when I show you how easy it is to make <time_token_22> <time_token_23> homemade croutons you'll never go back to the stuff in a box. Now when it comes to homemade <time_token_23> <time_token_25> croutons I really like to use ciabatta bread. That's because if you slice into it you'll see <time_token_25> <time_token_27> it has all of those nooks and crannies and that's where all of your delicious homemade Caesar salad <time_token_27> <time_token_28> dressing is going to end up. So it's a really great bread to use for something like this. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> But if you can't find it you could also use a baguette or French loaf. That would work as well. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> You're going to slice the bread into about one inch cubes, pop it in a bowl and to that you're <time_token_32> <time_token_35> going to add some olive oil, minced garlic and salt and pepper. Mix it all together and then turn <time_token_35> <time_token_37> it out on a cookie sheet. You then are going to bake at 375 for about 15 minutes. You're looking <time_token_37> <time_token_39> for the croutons to crisp up and turn golden brown. Now for the dressing. Now a classic Caesar salad <time_token_39> <time_token_41> typically does have raw egg in it and I know that that can make some people uneasy so instead <time_token_41> <time_token_42> we're going to use some mayonnaise which is pasteurized so there's no reason to worry. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> Then we're going to add the zest of one lemon and some lemon juice. Go ahead and give that a good <time_token_45> <time_token_47> whisk and then it's time for the anchovies. Now I know anchovies is another controversial subject <time_token_47> <time_token_49> when it comes to Caesar salad because a real traditionalist will say it is not a Caesar without <time_token_49> <time_token_51> the anchovies but I know that anchovies can also make people uneasy so what I like to do is instead <time_token_51> <time_token_53> of taking real anchovies and smashing them up I go right to the paste because then you tend to not <time_token_53> <time_token_55> even think about it. When you measure out the anchovy paste just think of it as a nice flavorful <time_token_55> <time_token_57> paste. Then you're going to add some Worcestershire sauce, add some olive oil, whisk it all together <time_token_57> <time_token_59> until combined and then the final step is to add about a half a cup of grated parmesan cheese <time_token_59> <time_token_61> and that's it your dressing is done. At this point your chicken is probably done marinating <time_token_61> <time_token_63> and it's time to grill it so go ahead and grill the chicken on all sides. Once it's done remove <time_token_63> <time_token_65> it and let it rest for about five minutes that will help retain all the juices into the chicken <time_token_65> <time_token_67> and make sure that your chicken doesn't dry out. So a classic Caesar salad is made with romaine <time_token_67> <time_token_69> lettuce. I love romaine lettuce because it has a wonderful crunch to it and the leaves are so big <time_token_69> <time_token_71> and beautiful so much so that I don't even like to cut it. I like to serve the leaves whole on <time_token_71> <time_token_72> the plate and let each person cut the lettuce themselves that way you'll have a really beautiful <time_token_72> <time_token_74> presentation. To our lettuce leaves we're going to add our croutons and our dressing give that all <time_token_74> <time_token_76> a good toss making sure that all the leaves and croutons are covered and then what I like to do <time_token_76> <time_token_79> is portion that out onto plates and then add our chicken and one other little thing that I like to <time_token_79> <time_token_80> add which is not traditional at all but it's something that my mother loves in a Caesar salad. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> She had it at a restaurant once and ever since then I've been throwing them into Caesar salads <time_token_82> <time_token_84> and that's some roasted pine nuts. It's really delicious and adds one more texture to your salad. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> Then you're going to finish the whole thing off with some more grated parmesan cheese <time_token_85> <time_token_87> and some freshly cracked pepper and there you have it a homemade grilled chicken Caesar salad <time_token_87> <time_token_89> that will rival any you'll be able to order at a restaurant I promise. Give this one a try and let <time_token_89> <time_token_91> me know what you think and keep those requests coming. I love hearing from you guys and if I <time_token_91> <time_token_92> know how to make it I'll definitely share the recipe. I'll see you next time.

Today on this episode we're making <time_token_4> <time_token_6> up a healthy bean burrito. As you probably know there are many different types of fillings <time_token_6> <time_token_9> you can put in burritos but this one contains no meat but is nevertheless fast and delicious. <time_token_9> <time_token_12> So let's get started. So what I'm going to do to get started here is add the re-fried <time_token_12> <time_token_15> beans to a preheated pan. You can pick these up in just about any grocery store. We're <time_token_15> <time_token_18> going to add some chili powder here and I'm going to stir it continuously over medium <time_token_18> <time_token_22> heat for oh I'd say three to four minutes just until it's hot. Now that the re-fried <time_token_22> <time_token_25> beans are hot I'm just going to set this aside. So what I've got here is a pan preheated over <time_token_25> <time_token_28> medium heat. What I'm going to do is place my flour tortilla in and I'm going to heat <time_token_28> <time_token_31> this for about a minute on each side. Now this is about a nine inch tortilla and you <time_token_31> <time_token_33> can pick these up in just about any grocery store or you can make them from scratch and <time_token_33> <time_token_36> of course I'll put a link below. Now that my tortilla is heated up I'm just going to <time_token_36> <time_token_39> remove it from the pan and set it aside on a plate. The first step in building our burrito <time_token_39> <time_token_43> is to place the re-fried beans on to the center of the tortilla and spread it out just <time_token_43> <time_token_47> so it's about an inch and a half away from the edge. Followed by the iceberg lettuce, <time_token_48> <time_token_54> the diced tomatoes, onions, the black olives, some jalapeno peppers, a nice layer of salsa. <time_token_54> <time_token_57> Now this is just medium salsa you can use hot or even mild for that matter. The sour <time_token_57> <time_token_61> cream and last but not least the grated cheddar cheese. Now I should add at this point in <time_token_61> <time_token_63> time don't fill the burrito too full or you're going to have a difficult time rolling it. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> So to roll this I'm going to bring one edge up over the toppings and tuck it under just <time_token_66> <time_token_71> so it's nice and tight and continue rolling it till it's just about to the end. Now what <time_token_71> <time_token_73> I'm going to do is take some sour cream and spread it over the end just to seal it up. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> Next I'm going to tuck in the ends. Now you don't have to do this but it just makes a <time_token_76> <time_token_81> really nice presentation. Lastly I'm going to cut the burrito diagonally and you're ready <time_token_81> <time_token_84> to serve. And there you have it our bean burrito served up with some salsa and sour <time_token_84> <time_token_88> cream on the side. A great no meat burrito. So those were our bean burritos believe me <time_token_88> <time_token_90> these are delicious. Stay tuned because in the near future we're going to be making up <time_token_90> <time_token_93> another type of burrito.

is colcannon, and it's a way to make sure that potatoes are about as elevated as <time_token_6> <time_token_6> you could make them. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> Super, super easy. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> This is a really old Irish recipe. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> I've got to make sure my pans are hot. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> This colcannon is, what it means is white-headed cabbage in Irish Gaelic, or one of them. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> It's traditionally served on Samhain. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> I hope I'm pronouncing that right. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> It's the day after Halloween. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> If I'm not, somebody tell me. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> It's really easy. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> Let me show you how you do it. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Back here, I've got, I'd say about two, two and a half pounds of Irish potatoes, and I'm <time_token_17> <time_token_18> just simmering them off. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> Over here, I've got about half a pound of bacon, and out of the pan that I did the bacon <time_token_20> <time_token_22> in, I drained out all of the grease, aha, about two cups of shredded cabbage. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> That's going to go right in here, and I don't want to stir fry it or saute it. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> I actually want to barely steam it. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> My timer's about to go off, so I'm putting a little bit of water. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> What this is going to do, it's going to get all the little bacon-y stuff off the bottom <time_token_29> <time_token_30> without the grease, and I don't want to let it go so long that it gets soggy. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> I just want to get it a little bit tender, so I'm going to cover this up. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Back here, just to get hot, a cup of cream. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> This is not the fat. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> You know we like Ireland for a reason, and we've got a cup of butter. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> In Ireland, and this is what is the best thing, when they serve this, they serve it family <time_token_38> <time_token_40> style, and they put it in the middle, and they put a hole in the center of the potatoes, <time_token_40> <time_token_40> and they fill that with melted butter. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> The whole deal is that you're supposed to take a forkful of potatoes and dip it in melted <time_token_42> <time_token_43> That's a good start. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> My potatoes are almost done. <time_token_44> <time_token_46> I've got my cabbage sitting here going to steam for probably five or six minutes. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> Potatoes are good. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> When I'm letting the cream and the butter get warm and come together, I'm going to <time_token_48> <time_token_49> drain these off and come right back, and I'll show you how super easy this is, and how really, <time_token_50> <time_token_52> All right, so I'm steaming off my potatoes, and then when I put them back into the warm <time_token_52> <time_token_53> pot, put them back into the hot pot because it helps dry them off. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> I threw in the cream and the butter that I had melted back here. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> I have the cabbage right here that I've given just a few minutes. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> You still want some texture and some crunch to it. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Not crunch, bite, I guess. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> That is coming right over here into the pot. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> I like to do the green onions that go in here. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> These are tiny. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> They've got very mild flavor, so I don't like to cook them. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> If you want to, if you want a softer flavor, go ahead and throw them in the pot with the <time_token_64> <time_token_65> cabbage for the last couple minutes, and then right in there. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> If you've added the cream and the butter, and it's a little too dry, save out some of <time_token_68> <time_token_70> the potato cooking water and use that, but then, if you do that, watch the salt because <time_token_70> <time_token_72> it'll be a little too salty, if you're not careful, so black pepper. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> All I'm doing is going to mash this up, transfer it over there, and get ready to show you what <time_token_76> <time_token_77> will probably be your new favorite comfort food. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> All right, you know I had to say the whole family-style thing. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> Unfortunately, I'm here all by myself. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> I guess my camera got uncapped. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> There we go. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> You've got to love over the top, ridiculous, and I think this defines it. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> A little bit of green onion, a little bit of cabbage, a little bit of bacon, and right <time_token_87> <time_token_88> into the melted butter. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> I think I'm going to move to Ireland. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> Oh my God, that's good.

It's Angel. Today I'm going to be cooking up something a bit different. I am actually <time_token_6> <time_token_8> going to be making us lunches to go. Now I absolutely love hot soup and I love ramen <time_token_8> <time_token_11> so I thought it would be fun to make some DIY ramen bowls to go. Now the cool thing <time_token_11> <time_token_12> about it is that it only takes about 5 minutes to put together. You can make them the night <time_token_12> <time_token_14> before and then take them to work or to school. Think of these as healthy instant noodles. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Everything you need to make these soups are in these glass jars. Now as an adagonist, <time_token_15> <time_token_18> I'm going to show you how to make two of my favorite flavors, miso and chicken. So let's <time_token_18> <time_token_19> get started. First, start by cooking your noodles. I'm using these deliciously yummy, <time_token_19> <time_token_21> gluten-free ramen noodles which were made in Japan and come in these easy to use single <time_token_21> <time_token_23> serve pouches. You can find them at your local Japanese grocer. Bring a pot of water to a boil <time_token_23> <time_token_25> and cook your noodles. Mine cook in about 3 minutes. After that, remove and rinse the <time_token_25> <time_token_27> noodles under cold water to stop the cooking process. This will help keep them nice and chewy <time_token_27> <time_token_30> for the next day. Now comes the fun part. It's time to assemble our ramen jars. Now I am using <time_token_30> <time_token_32> these wide mouth 32 ounce glass jars and I really like using them because not only are they dishwasher <time_token_32> <time_token_34> safe but they're also big enough to hold all the yummy ingredients and soup that we'll be putting <time_token_34> <time_token_36> in here. Now you can use whatever containers you want. Just remember to stay away from plastic <time_token_36> <time_token_39> because we will be adding hot water later. Now let's start with our miso ramen bowl. I'm using <time_token_39> <time_token_41> about one and a half tablespoons of shiro miso which is white miso. Then go ahead and put your <time_token_41> <time_token_43> noodles on top. Then over to the side I've prepared some ingredients which will be wrapping up in small <time_token_43> <time_token_45> pieces of plastic wrap. So I've got soy sauce eggs which I made last night and I just cut them in <time_token_45> <time_token_47> half. I'll put a link to my video on how to make these if you're interested. Then we'll wrap some <time_token_47> <time_token_49> tofu. You can also add vegetables like corn if you like. Next wrap together your green onions <time_token_49> <time_token_52> and also I have a little bit of ichimi togarashi powder which is just crushed red pepper. Finally <time_token_52> <time_token_53> I have some seaweed which came wrapped already so I'm just going to place that inside the jar. <time_token_53> <time_token_56> Now for the chicken ramen bowl. First add chicken bouillon paste. I'm using about one and a half <time_token_57> <time_token_59> teaspoons. Then the noodles on top. I'm also adding in a handful of raw broccoli and some shiitake mushrooms. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> Next I also have soy sauce eggs and some tofu. You can also add some cooked chicken as well. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> Leftover chicken pieces are great too. And finally our garnish our green onions. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Once you have all your ingredients in your jars go ahead and cover it with the lid. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Then you can store it in your fridge and it's ready for you the next day. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> When you're ready for your chicken ramen lunch remove the items in the plastic wrap. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> Add two cups of boiling water which is a bit more than halfway full and let it sit covered for two <time_token_72> <time_token_74> minutes. After two minutes stir really well so the chicken bouillon dissolves. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> Then you can go ahead and add your tofu, eggs and garnish. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Next let's prepare the miso ramen. Again remove the ingredients in the plastic wrap. <time_token_79> <time_token_82> Add two cups of hot water. Wait two minutes then stir and add your ingredients saving the dried <time_token_82> <time_token_85> seaweed for last. When you're done your ramen soup should look like this. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> So that's it! A quick DIY ramen bowl to go and two delicious flavors. The great thing about them <time_token_89> <time_token_91> is that they're a healthy alternative to instant noodles and you can customize these bowls with <time_token_91> <time_token_92> your own favorite ingredients to make your favorite soups to go.

<time_token_4> <time_token_5> you need a pound of ground beef you need some soft tortillas you need about <time_token_5> <time_token_7> six of these you want to help okay I'll let you help okay okay okay so you need <time_token_7> <time_token_8> six soft tortillas some chunky salsa we're using the mild because a little <time_token_8> <time_token_9> one here is gonna eat with us so if you would like it extra spicy get you some <time_token_9> <time_token_10> spicy yep and then we'll need this is tomato soup and this is using the <time_token_10> <time_token_11> healthy request so one can of that and then you'll need some cheddar we're <time_token_11> <time_token_12> using some cheddar jack but you can use whatever kind of cheddar you want so <time_token_12> <time_token_13> that's all you need we'll get started <time_token_14> <time_token_16> what you doing here knucklehead are you knucklehead yeah they don't want to see <time_token_17> <time_token_18> you that close up first thing we are going to do we're gonna put it on stove <time_token_18> <time_token_19> top medium right here and we're going to brown the ground beef so we'll do that <time_token_19> <time_token_20> and then we'll hey what are you doing okay so while you're waiting for your <time_token_20> <time_token_22> beef to cook then we are going to do cut tortillas into one inch squares I'm just <time_token_22> <time_token_23> using a pizza cutter here and cutting board so just it's real easy cut them in <time_token_23> <time_token_25> one inch they don't have to be exact just cut them in little I guess bite <time_token_25> <time_token_26> sized pieces and like I said it doesn't have to be exact so you're gonna do <time_token_26> <time_token_28> about six of the these are six inch tortillas about six of those so that is <time_token_28> <time_token_29> roughly that's two tortilla okay and as the beef is cooking we're gonna stir it <time_token_29> <time_token_30> up and break it up okay so then once this is done we are going to drain off <time_token_30> <time_token_32> that and I will show you a fairly easy way of doing that okay so now that the <time_token_32> <time_token_33> beef is browned we are going to turn off the heat we're gonna move all the meat <time_token_33> <time_token_36> over to one side then we are going to raise our ninja up and we're going to <time_token_36> <time_token_38> set it on the lid so do this one handy okay so like I so okay or if you have a <time_token_38> <time_token_39> friend or somebody that can help you just want to elevate a little bit and <time_token_39> <time_token_40> allow all this grease to run over to one side and then you can either use paper <time_token_40> <time_token_42> towels or a turkey baster to suck up all the so now got most of the oil out <time_token_42> <time_token_44> or all the grease out we've put it back on level surface and we are going to add <time_token_44> <time_token_45> in our can of condensed tomato soup and you can either use the healthy request <time_token_45> <time_token_46> or just the regular this is a 10 and 3 quarter ounce can you're gonna add this <time_token_46> <time_token_47> we have our tomato soup in there and then we are going to add in the salsa <time_token_47> <time_token_49> can you pour that in please good job did it splash on your cheek okay and <time_token_49> <time_token_50> then we're gonna add half the water okay pour it in yeah don't touch it it's hot <time_token_50> <time_token_51> okay there we go we added in half a cup of water and then we are going to add in <time_token_51> <time_token_53> our tortillas so you can help me see all these tortillas right here see all these <time_token_53> <time_token_53> don't see it's not cheese fine it's tortilla you can take them and put them <time_token_53> <time_token_55> inside here like that oh yeah just toss them in there <time_token_57> <time_token_59> I'm gonna put it on high one at a time he's gonna make it in there <time_token_61> <time_token_63> okay keep throwing them in there doing a good job sweet pea your good helper <time_token_66> <time_token_67> thank you sweet pea thank you sweet pea I'm moving them down for you I'm not <time_token_67> <time_token_72> gonna put them in thank you sweet pea go all done good job okay that's it thank you <time_token_72> <time_token_74> okay so now that everything's in the ninja I'm just stirring it up and then you're gonna <time_token_74> <time_token_76> bring it to a boil it's pretty well mixed so now I'm just gonna let it sit and bring it to a boil <time_token_76> <time_token_78> okay so you can see it is boiling I'm going to turn down to low and I'm gonna I'm gonna stir it <time_token_78> <time_token_79> and let it simmer for over five minutes okay so it's been five minutes I'm gonna turn that off <time_token_79> <time_token_81> I'm gonna stir it up a little bit and you can tell it's um thickening up quite a bit now it <time_token_81> <time_token_82> calls for at half a cup of cheese but you're a fan of cheese just go crazy I guess the cheese <time_token_82> <time_token_85> police won't come after you if you're adding more so just sprinkle it over the top let it melt a <time_token_85> <time_token_86> little bit let it sit there and then it's ready to serve are you ready to eat yeah yep you're gonna

<time_token_2> Hey guys, I'm April McKinney and I'm excited today to show you a recipe for General So's <time_token_3> <time_token_3> You've probably seen this on many of the Chinese takeout restaurants. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> It's on almost every menu of those restaurants. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> And usually it's deep fried and then tossed in a really thick, syrupy sauce. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> It tastes really good, but it's not very good for you. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> So I came up with a recipe that's a lot lighter, but it still tastes great. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> It's really easy. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> And this is one of those recipes, you know, I think all the recipes that I do for videos <time_token_8> <time_token_9> are good, or else I wouldn't make a video of them, but this is one that I really felt <time_token_9> <time_token_10> As soon as I ate it, I thought, okay, this is a home run. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> So if you don't try any of our recipes, you need to try this one because I think you'll <time_token_11> <time_token_11> really like it. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> So now I'm going to mix up the sauce. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> And what I'm going to start with is actually a quarter cup of low sodium chicken broth <time_token_12> <time_token_13> Either one works. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> And if you didn't have chicken stock, you could use water to replace this. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> It won't be quite as flavorful, but it will still work. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> The next thing I'm going to do is two tablespoons of rice vinegar. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> You can find this in the Asian section or the ethnic section of the grocery store, or <time_token_16> <time_token_17> it may be in the vinegar section, which depends on what store you're at. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> But really easy to find, very inexpensive, and a great ingredient for Asian cooking. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> The next thing is two tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> I always use the low sodium because soy sauce has a ton of salt in it. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> And I like soy sauce, so I don't like to not use very much. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> This way I can still use, you know, two tablespoons and not worry too much about the salt content. <time_token_22> <time_token_24> The next thing I have is a tablespoon of brown sugar, and this is just going to add a little <time_token_24> <time_token_25> bit of sweetness because most Asian food does have a little bit of sweetness and a hotness <time_token_25> <time_token_25> and a sourness. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> It's kind of got all these different flavor components. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> So we do need a little bit of that, and the brown sugar is going to be great because it's <time_token_26> <time_token_27> got a really rich flavor, more than just a white sugar would, so we don't have to use <time_token_27> <time_token_27> quite as much. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> The other thing I'm going to do is I have got two cloves of garlic that I've minced <time_token_29> <time_token_29> I'm just going to put those right in here. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> I'm going to add a lot of flavor. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Okay, and now a pinch of red pepper flakes, probably about an eighth to a quarter of a <time_token_31> <time_token_31> Depends on how spicy you like it. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Generally, those chicken is usually sort of spicy, so I like to do about a quarter teaspoon <time_token_32> <time_token_32> of the red pepper flakes. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Alright, and the next thing is kind of an interesting ingredient. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> This is actually fresh ginger. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> It's ground up. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Normally, you know, with like a jar of garlic or something, I don't really recommend using <time_token_35> <time_token_36> those because they don't taste as fresh, but for ginger, because I only use it really rarely, <time_token_36> <time_token_37> usually I use a little piece of it and then end up throwing the whole thing away, this <time_token_37> <time_token_37> comes in handy, and it still tastes pretty good. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> So I'm going to do about two teaspoons of this ground ginger. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Plus, it's a lot easier to use this than to peel and mince up ginger. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> So let's just get this whisked up, and this is really our sauce. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> The only thing I'm going to add is about half of these scallions. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> The rest I'm just going to use for garnish on top of the chicken, and that's perfect. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> It's easy as that, really simple, easy to find ingredients, so that part's done. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> The next thing we want to do is, obviously, we're not going to deep fry this. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> You're probably not going to see, hmm, probably anything deep fried on my recipes. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> So what I am going to do, though, is I'm still going to give it a little bit of a crust, <time_token_46> <time_token_47> and it's going to be really easy. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> What I have is a cup of regular all-purpose flour. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> I've got a pound and a half of chicken breast here, and you can see the size. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> There are about maybe a half inch cubes of chicken that I just cut up. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> See if I can get these in here without spilling them. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> There we go, perfect. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> I'm going to seal this up. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> I love to use Ziploc bags for this kind of thing, so you can just throw it away and you <time_token_53> <time_token_53> don't have to worry about cleaning it. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> And then you're just going to give it a shake. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> All right, each of these are coated with a little bit of the flour now, and so what I'm <time_token_55> <time_token_56> going to do is head on over to the stove, and I'll show you how to put this all together. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> All right, so here I have a large skillet. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> I've got a tablespoon of canola oil that has been heated up. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> It's over medium-high heat. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> I really want this skillet to be nice and hot because I want to get this fizzled. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> I want to make sure that that flour gets nice and browned because we want to have that fried <time_token_60> <time_token_61> effect on this chicken, even though we're obviously not frying it, and it is going to <time_token_61> <time_token_61> be a lot healthier than the other version. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Okay, as you can see, I'm sort of starting to turn these over, and what you want is just <time_token_62> <time_token_63> to have a slight golden color, about like that, that little golden color, and then you <time_token_63> <time_token_63> can turn it right over on the other side. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Okay, these look perfect. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> They've got a nice color to them on all sides. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> It really sort of forms a nice crust that is going to make this taste like the real <time_token_66> <time_token_67> So let's take those right out, and then we'll add in our sauce. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> We'll go right in, and I'm actually going to cook it for about a minute or so just to <time_token_69> <time_token_70> kind of get it heated up and let the garlic soften a little bit, and then we'll add back <time_token_70> <time_token_70> in the chicken. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Okay, sauce is in. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Now let's get the chicken back in, and what I'm going to do is just begin to toss this <time_token_72> <time_token_73> around, and that sauce is going to thicken because the flour will be put on the outside <time_token_73> <time_token_73> of the chicken. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> We don't have to use cornstarch or anything because the flour is going to thicken up that <time_token_74> <time_token_75> sauce, and I'm just going to toss it around while it's on about medium heat until everything <time_token_75> <time_token_76> is coated and all the chicken is cooked through. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> All right, our general sauce chicken is done, so I'm just going to put it in this little <time_token_77> <time_token_78> serving dish, and that looks fantastic. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> And looking at that, you would think this is not a very healthy dish, but actually it <time_token_79> <time_token_80> is really light, and I promise you it tastes fantastic. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Almost as good as the stuff from the restaurant, and really it tastes better to me because <time_token_81> <time_token_81> you know you're not eating just complete crap, you know, you're eating something that's <time_token_81> <time_token_82> really good for you. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> So I'm going to sprinkle these scallions that I reserved right over the top to make it look <time_token_83> <time_token_84> pretty, just like they do with the restaurant. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> This is something fun to do. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> You can make this. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> You see it's really quick to do. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> You can serve it with some brown rice and maybe some steamed broccoli or snap peas, and you've <time_token_86> <time_token_87> got just a Chinese meal that's really healthy and easy to do, you can feel great about. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> So I have got to get a taste of this. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> I cannot wait any longer. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> Love this stuff. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> It's a little spicy, it's a little sweet, it certainly doesn't taste like it's healthy, <time_token_90> <time_token_91> so I think you're really going to like this, give it a try, and enjoy. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> And it's spelled T-S-O. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> So if you're like me, you've probably gone through a lot of variations of how you say <time_token_94> <time_token_95> it, sometimes I used to say

It's Kevin Long from Big Night Entertainment Group and this is something <time_token_4> <time_token_7> that I'm not super expert at but I try real hard. This is some nigiri, tuna and salmon. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> So basically your nigiri, the root of the word basically means finger of rice. So we've <time_token_9> <time_token_12> got some prepared sushi rice over here and you're simply going to form the rice and put <time_token_12> <time_token_15> the fish over it. We have some super nice yellowfin tuna here. The idea for a nigiri <time_token_15> <time_token_18> cut on the tuna is to really kind of take the fish and you're going to cut it really <time_token_18> <time_token_20> at an angle. So you can see I have the square block here. I'm going to cut this at an angle. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> Your first piece you can use for something else. You're just going to cut another thin <time_token_22> <time_token_25> slice to produce this sort of angled cut. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> Then we're going to do basically the same thing. It's a little bigger piece with the salmon. <time_token_35> <time_token_38> We're going to do that same sort of angled cut here. Produce these nice thin almost like <time_token_38> <time_token_44> bias cut pieces of fish. So when you're operating with your prepared sushi rice, <time_token_44> <time_token_47> you always want your hands damp so that the sticky sushi rice won't stick to your hands. <time_token_47> <time_token_50> You don't want to get too wet. You just form this little football almost. You don't want to crush <time_token_50> <time_token_54> the rice. You just want to form it fairly gently and then drape the fish over it. Traditionally <time_token_54> <time_token_58> form and lay that big nice piece of fish draped over there formed over the rice. So it's that same <time_token_58> <time_token_61> little shape. You start out, you usually kind of crush it a little bit. People are usually scared <time_token_61> <time_token_63> to not crush it enough or to keep it together or they're scared that they over crush it. You want <time_token_63> <time_token_67> to kind of find that happy medium there where your rice comes out nice and sort of held together <time_token_67> <time_token_71> but not really smushed. Try to do as much as you can with the one hand on the rice so you don't <time_token_71> <time_token_74> pass it to the other hand. It's the same thing with the tuna. It basically goes over, gets a <time_token_74> <time_token_78> little form in, gets turned around. You're just going to get that right balance of keeping your <time_token_78> <time_token_83> hands just wet enough where that rice doesn't stick to you. A little spin around forming that <time_token_83> <time_token_87> so that basically the fish kind of drapes over the sides. It's pretty simple but that is basically <time_token_87> <time_token_90> how you put it together. So a little nigiri of salmon and tuna. So here you go.

This is Derek House from DHFCNS.com and today I'm going to show you guys how to make my bodybuilding <time_token_2> <time_token_4> chicken parmesan. It's quick, simple, and more than calorie friendly. So let's get to it. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> The first thing you're going to do is take out one and a half pounds or 24 ounces of chicken <time_token_9> <time_token_11> breast, trim the fat off of them, and then cut each piece in half this way. So for every chicken <time_token_11> <time_token_13> breast that you have, you should end up with two pieces that are about this big. After you slice <time_token_13> <time_token_15> your chicken breast, put it off to the side and then take out two bowls, one small one and one <time_token_15> <time_token_16> medium sized one. One thing I do want to mention really quick is if you want to prep enough for <time_token_16> <time_token_18> the whole week, you can easily double or even triple this recipe. Now the first thing we're <time_token_18> <time_token_21> going to add into the small bowl is two extra large egg whites and then one tablespoon of <time_token_21> <time_token_24> olive oil. Go ahead and lightly mix those together. The first thing you're going to add <time_token_24> <time_token_26> into the medium sized bowl is two thirds a cup or 60 grams of whole wheat breadcrumbs. Whether or <time_token_26> <time_token_28> not you want to use seasoned ones is completely up to you. And then eight tablespoons or 40 grams <time_token_28> <time_token_31> of grated Parmesan cheese. Mix both of those together. Next, preheat your oven on 450, take <time_token_31> <time_token_34> out a baking sheet and then coat it with some nonstick cooking spray. Put your chicken breast <time_token_34> <time_token_36> onto your baking sheet. Take out a pastry brush and then brush each chicken breast with your wet mix. <time_token_36> <time_token_39> After you brush your chicken breast, dip it into your dry mix. If there's any dry mix left over, <time_token_39> <time_token_41> just evenly distribute it across the top of your chicken breast. Last before the oven, <time_token_41> <time_token_43> coat the top of each chicken breast with some nonstick cooking spray and then into the oven <time_token_43> <time_token_46> on 450 for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, take them out, flip them over and then evenly distribute <time_token_46> <time_token_49> half a cup or 123 grams of pasta sauce across the tops of them and then three fourths a cup or 84 <time_token_49> <time_token_51> grams of reduced fat mozzarella cheese. After that, put them back into the oven on 450 for around 5 <time_token_51> <time_token_53> to 10 minutes or until your cheese is melted. After 10 minutes for me, it does look done, <time_token_53> <time_token_58> so I'm just going to take it out and there is your bodybuilding chicken Parmesan. Three quick tips, <time_token_58> <time_token_59> one, you can use whatever type of pasta sauce you want. Today, I'm using a no salt added one, <time_token_59> <time_token_61> but for example, sometimes I like it spicy, so I'll use a spicy pasta sauce. Two, you can <time_token_61> <time_token_64> eat this with quinoa, rice, pasta, beans, laffy taffy or whatever you prefer. And three, a silicone <time_token_64> <time_token_66> pastry brush is a great investment for your kitchen. This one only costs around $8 shipped, <time_token_66> <time_token_68> is easy to clean, dishwasher safe and will last you forever. I do post a link to this one in the <time_token_68> <time_token_69> description below. As you guys saw, the chicken Parmesan is done, so now I'm just going to try <time_token_69> <time_token_72> a bite. So if Scarface was a bodybuilder that dealt chicken Parmesan instead of cocaine, this <time_token_72> <time_token_74> would be the best seller. All of the flavors of a chicken Parmesan are there, absolutely delicious. <time_token_74> <time_token_77> As far as the calories go in the whole recipe, there's 1515, 43 grams of fat, 55 grams of carbs <time_token_77> <time_token_79> and 227 grams of protein. So if you divide this up into six servings like I do, in each serving, <time_token_79> <time_token_81> there's going to be around 252 calories, seven grams of fat, nine grams of carbs and 38 grams <time_token_81> <time_token_83> of protein. So I have a question for you guys. Since this was one of my favorite meals growing up, <time_token_83> <time_token_84> what were some of your favorites? Let me know in the comments below.

<time_token_2> <time_token_3> Today on this episode we are making up a world famous dish that is commonly found in Thai <time_token_3> <time_token_3> eateries, Pat Thai. <time_token_3> <time_token_5> We were traveling the other day and came across this mobile restaurant that was serving it. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> We bought some and we thought boy is this ever good so we thought we would try and make <time_token_6> <time_token_7> it and share it with you. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> I have to mention that there are many different ways of doing this and this is by no means <time_token_8> <time_token_9> authentic so if you are Thai don't be offended. <time_token_9> <time_token_9> So let's get started. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> What I have here are some Thai noodles. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> I just picked these up at my local grocery store. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> You can also get them at any Asian store. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> So we will add these to a large container and pour a couple of cups of water over the <time_token_14> <time_token_15> top just enough to make sure the noodles are submerged. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> And what you need to do is allow these to soak for about 30 minutes. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> In the meantime what I'm going to do is begin preparing the sauce. <time_token_19> <time_token_21> And the main ingredients for it are fish sauce, chili sauce, sugar and tamarind paste. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> What I have here is some tamarind paste that I just picked up at my local Asian store. <time_token_22> <time_token_24> Now this is really a thick concentrated paste so what I did is add it to a measuring cup, <time_token_24> <time_token_25> put in some water and mushed it down and mixed it up and of course remove the seeds. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> And if you want to know the exact measurements I did a write up on the blog so just check <time_token_27> <time_token_28> In making this dish it's pretty important that you prepare everything in advance just <time_token_28> <time_token_28> so things go smoothly. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> So what I have here is some shrimp that I've deveined and de-shelled, some extra firm tofu <time_token_30> <time_token_32> that I've cubed up and fried, some eggs, chopped shallots, some garlic, some garlic chives, <time_token_32> <time_token_33> bean sprouts and some roasted peanuts. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> Okay let's make the sauce first by adding the tamarind to a preheated pan, followed <time_token_36> <time_token_38> by the fish sauce, the chili sauce, the sugar. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Usually palm sugar is used in this recipe but if you're on the other side of the world <time_token_40> <time_token_41> like me, white sugar will do just fine. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> So we're just going to give this a stir over medium heat. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Bring it to a boil and set it aside. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Next what we're going to do is add some oil to a preheated pan. <time_token_46> <time_token_49> Add the shallots in, followed by the chopped garlic and I'll stir and saute this just for <time_token_49> <time_token_50> a minute or two until they're fragrant. <time_token_51> <time_token_54> Then we'll place the shrimp in, followed by the fried tofu and give it a stir until <time_token_54> <time_token_54> the shrimp become pinkish. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> Now we'll add in the Thai noodles that we soaked a while ago, some water and I'm just <time_token_57> <time_token_58> going to toss this until they're thoroughly mixed. <time_token_59> <time_token_62> Now we'll push everything to one side of the pan, add in a little bit more oil just <time_token_62> <time_token_64> so it's not going to be dry, crack the egg in, so remember one egg is for one serving. <time_token_64> <time_token_67> I'm just going to kind of break the yolk here, scramble it up just a little bit and fold <time_token_67> <time_token_68> it into the noodles. <time_token_69> <time_token_71> Next what you're going to do is pour the sauce over and stir it around until the sauce coats <time_token_72> <time_token_74> Now I should mention here that everything is done over medium high heat and of course <time_token_74> <time_token_75> you want to make sure everything is well coated and the noodles have absorbed the liquid. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> Lastly what we're going to do is add in the bean sprouts and the garlic chives and toss <time_token_78> <time_token_80> it for another minute or two until the noodles are soft, dried and fairly tangled. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> By the way this is a serving for one but if you're serving two or three or you're a big <time_token_82> <time_token_82> eater simply double or triple the recipe. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> Now we've plated this up we're going to garnish it with some roasted peanuts, a few <time_token_85> <time_token_88> chives on the side, some bean sprouts and lime wedges and there you have it our delicious <time_token_88> <time_token_89> pad thai, a heavenly taste of Thailand. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> So that was our pad thai, I could eat this three times a week and I'm sure if you make <time_token_91> <time_token_92> this you'll say the same thing. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> If you know of some other food icons from countries around the world drop us a line <time_token_93> <time_token_94> below and we'll try and make it.

Happy New Year. Hope you're <time_token_2> <time_token_4> having a great year so far and I hope you had a fun and safe holiday. Today on <time_token_4> <time_token_6> The Aimless Cook we're going to be making a Japanese noodle bowl called <time_token_6> <time_token_8> tsukimi udon. Now tsukimi means moon viewing and it's named that because of <time_token_8> <time_token_10> the egg that we're going to add at the end. It resembles the moon. It's a really <time_token_10> <time_token_12> easy soup base that we've done before but I'm going to show you with some new <time_token_12> <time_token_14> ingredients how to put this together. It's really easy to do. I'm going to show <time_token_14> <time_token_15> you how to do it right now on The Aimless Cook. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> So let's start with our soup base by combining in a small bowl two tablespoons <time_token_19> <time_token_22> of brown sugar with three tablespoons each of soy sauce and mirin. Now we're <time_token_22> <time_token_24> going to take two-thirds of that mixture and put it into a saucepan where we're <time_token_24> <time_token_25> just going to heat it up and simmer it until everything is dissolved and <time_token_25> <time_token_28> combined. Finally to that soy mixture we're going to add two and a half cups <time_token_28> <time_token_31> of dashi. Now we're just going to mix that together again bring it to a simmer <time_token_31> <time_token_34> and then let's move on. Over here on the cutting board I got a bunch of nice <time_token_34> <time_token_35> fresh oyster mushrooms. What I'm going to do is I'm just going to cut the bottom <time_token_35> <time_token_38> off of this so I can hand shred them to manageable pieces and then I'm going to <time_token_38> <time_token_40> add them to a frying pan with some butter, two tablespoons of butter, on high <time_token_40> <time_token_42> heat. I'm going to saute them for a few minutes until they're fragrant and golden <time_token_42> <time_token_45> brown. Now to that I'm going to add the remaining soy mixture from the bowl from <time_token_45> <time_token_47> earlier and I'm going to continue cooking until that mixture thickens. Now when that <time_token_47> <time_token_49> thickens up I'm just going to take them off the heat and set aside. In another <time_token_49> <time_token_51> large pot at a rolling boil here I got some udon noodles and I'm just going to <time_token_51> <time_token_53> cook them according to the directions until they are done. It usually takes <time_token_53> <time_token_55> about three or four minutes. Now I got some lemons and what I'm going to do here <time_token_55> <time_token_57> is I'm just going to lightly and very carefully shave the zest. I need a piece <time_token_57> <time_token_59> about as big as a fingernail and I'm going to use one piece in each serving <time_token_59> <time_token_61> to add a little more depth to the flavor. You're going to notice it and trust me. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> Now before I assemble I'm just going to add about six snow peas to my simmering <time_token_64> <time_token_67> broth and I'm just going to briefly cook them for about 60 seconds. To assemble <time_token_67> <time_token_68> I'm going to start by putting a piece of lemon zest on the bottom of each bowl <time_token_68> <time_token_70> followed by the strained udon noodles. I'm going to follow that with some soup <time_token_70> <time_token_73> stock and then top with the snow peas mushroom and then finally the egg. Now <time_token_73> <time_token_75> you can use a raw egg or in this case I use some onsen tamago. Now if you want <time_token_75> <time_token_76> the recipe for onsen tamago you can click on the link in the video <time_token_76> <time_token_79> description below. Finally we're going to garnish with a sprinkle of furikake <time_token_79> <time_token_79> and then serve. <time_token_86> <time_token_89> So that is it that's my recipe for tsukimi udon. Hope you take this recipe <time_token_89> <time_token_90> make it yours and have fun in the kitchen which brings me to my question <time_token_90> <time_token_92> of the day. How do you eat your noodles? Do you slurp them really loud or do you <time_token_92> <time_token_95> try to eat them quietly?

Then we'll be using scallops and shrimp. <time_token_9> <time_token_12> Make sure you devein the shrimp and peel the shrimp and if they're frozen keep them in the fridge overnight <time_token_12> <time_token_14> so that they defrost. Also we'll be using these sticks I like to call them Irish spears. <time_token_15> <time_token_18> You put them in the water overnight so they don't burn on the grill while you're cooking your stuff. <time_token_18> <time_token_22> Now first we're going to make the marination sauce and first you're going to put in a half a cup of butter right in the bowl there. <time_token_22> <time_token_25> Then we're going to put in 7 tablespoons of lemon juice, freshly squeezed. <time_token_25> <time_token_29> And then we're going to put in 5 tablespoons of cheddar sauce. There we go, very nice. <time_token_29> <time_token_32> And then we're going to put about 2 dashes of garlic salt, you know, if you like more salt you can go ahead and add that. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> And about 1 dash of paprika and a dash of love. <time_token_34> <time_token_39> Once you mix it you're going to put it in the microwave for about until the butter is melted, maybe a minute, minute and a half. <time_token_39> <time_token_42> Take about 1 third of the mix and set it aside for basing for the shish kebabs on the grill. <time_token_42> <time_token_45> Then you're going to put the scallops and the shrimp in a sealable bag so that they can marinate in there by themselves. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> So you're just going to lift them all and put them in there. <time_token_48> <time_token_50> And when you marinate them you have to set them aside and mix them for about an hour. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Well you set them aside for about an hour and then mix them. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> Mix them and then set them aside for about an hour. There we go. <time_token_53> <time_token_56> You're going to pour the mix inside the bag. Don't spill. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Just push it around a little bit. <time_token_58> <time_token_61> After about an hour you take them out of the fridge and then it's time to Irish spear them. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> My favorite part! <time_token_63> <time_token_64> And start with a lemon wedge first. <time_token_65> <time_token_67> You put that right on there and then you're going to alternate the shrimp and the scallops. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> So you get them nice and even. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> So you're just going to feel the whole kebab up. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> And that's about enough, right? Should we add one more? <time_token_76> <time_token_76> We'll add one more shrimp. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Alright, that should be good. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Now you want to make sure that you don't put them too close together. <time_token_79> <time_token_81> Because if you put them too close together they don't cook all the way around. <time_token_81> <time_token_85> Now the reason we put lemon wedges on them is that when they're done cooking you're going to stand them up on the grill while they're hot. <time_token_85> <time_token_87> And then you're going to squeeze the lemon wedge so that the juice runs down the whole stick. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Alright, that gives them their last minute flavor. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> That lemon of that. <time_token_90> <time_token_93> Grill uncovered over medium hot heat for about 6 minutes until opening once. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> Brush with reserved marinade, the one we set aside earlier. <time_token_94> <time_token_96> Grill 8 to 10 minutes longer or until shrimp turn pink. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> And I hope you enjoy daily shrimp and scallops shabab.

A wooden spoon. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> A sieve. A slotted spoon. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> A chopping board. A knife. A ladle. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> And a tray. Step 2. Make the broth. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> Heat one of the saucepans over a moderate temperature <time_token_36> <time_token_38> and add the peanut oil. Followed by the leeks. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Sweat them slightly. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Then add the carrots. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Crushed garlic. And the ginger. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> And cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Next, stir in the chicken stock. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> And the soy sauce. And finally season with salt and pepper. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 to 20 minutes. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Step 3. Sieve the broth. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Place the sieve over the other saucepan and strain the broth. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Then put it back on the heat. Step 4. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> Poach the chicken and mushrooms. Place the chicken. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Followed by the mushrooms into the hot broth. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> Slowly poach for about 7 minutes. Don't let it boil. <time_token_62> <time_token_65> Keep it over a low heat. If the chicken becomes too hot it will dry out. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> This way it will stay moist. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Using the slotted spoon, remove the chicken breast <time_token_68> <time_token_69> and the mushrooms from the broth and put aside. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> Step 5. Cook the noodles. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Add the noodles to the broth and raise the heat to a simmer. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> Leave them to cook for about 3 minutes. Step 6. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> Prepare the chicken. Moving lengthwise along the chicken breast, <time_token_78> <time_token_81> cut into fairly thin slices. Then take the hard boiled eggs <time_token_81> <time_token_81> and chop them in half. <time_token_82> <time_token_85> Step 7. Serve. Place the noodles into a soup bowl <time_token_85> <time_token_87> and ladle the broth on top. Then arrange the mushrooms on one side. <time_token_87> <time_token_90> Followed by the eggs and chicken. And finally the spring onions. <time_token_90> <time_token_92> Add a little more broth and your soup is ready. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> And that's how to make chicken ramen. The video jug way.

show you guys how to make Korean style spicy pork aka Taeji bulgogi. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> Typically we just stir fry it with spice but I like to boil it first to drain the fat out <time_token_3> <time_token_4> so it's a little bit healthier. <time_token_4> <time_token_4> Alright, let's get started. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> Okay, so I have my pork here and I sliced it in the middle so it's smaller pieces. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> Typically I don't like pork, I use chicken so if you want, you guys can use chicken. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> Okie dokie, so we have our green onions and regular onion. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> I will list the specific measurements down below so make sure you guys check that out. <time_token_9> <time_token_12> I have hot chili paste, low sodium soy sauce, we have sake, this actually eliminates the <time_token_12> <time_token_13> smell of pork when you cook it. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> We have pureed garlic and then we have hot chili flakes here. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> And then you're going to need a large bowl to mix everything up later on. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> Then I have my lettuce which I love to eat with my pork and then also my tofu which we're <time_token_17> <time_token_17> going to boil. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> So I forgot to mention this earlier but we do need another large bowl to make our hot <time_token_18> <time_token_19> Here I am adding 10 tablespoons of hot pepper flakes. <time_token_19> <time_token_21> If you guys are sensitive to spice, I would probably use 6 or 7 or maybe even 5 but it <time_token_21> <time_token_22> all varies on the brand that you purchased. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> The brand that I purchased for this one was extremely hot and I didn't know about it until <time_token_23> <time_token_25> after but even when I was cooking the pork, when I was sauteing it, I knew right away <time_token_25> <time_token_26> that it was going to be super, super spicy because my nose was tingling because it was <time_token_27> <time_token_29> Okay so now we're going to add 1 tablespoon of hot chili paste to our hot pepper flakes. <time_token_30> <time_token_34> Now we have to add 5 tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce to our bowl. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> You guys can use regular soy sauce if you want if you guys don't have low sodium but <time_token_35> <time_token_35> I prefer low sodium. <time_token_35> <time_token_39> So now we're just going to mix everything up together so it's all blended and evenly <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Alright so now it's time for the good part, we're going to be adding 2 tablespoons of <time_token_42> <time_token_43> sake to our mixture. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> So now that our water is boiling, let's just add in the pork to drain out the fat. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> If you guys want to, you can repeat this step to take out the extra, extra fat but <time_token_49> <time_token_50> I've boiled it once only for 5 minutes because we're going to be sauteing it later on anyway. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> Alright so after 5 minutes we're going to drain the greasy, greasy, nasty water and <time_token_51> <time_token_52> we're going to rinse the pork with cold water and put it to the side for a bit. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Alright next step, we're going to boil our tofu for 5 minutes. <time_token_54> <time_token_56> While our tofu is boiling, we're going to add our pork to a large bowl and add 3 tablespoons <time_token_61> <time_token_61> of the chili paste that we made earlier. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Now we're going to need half a tablespoon of sesame oil. <time_token_66> <time_token_70> Now we're going to add 1 tablespoon of garlic, now we're going to need half a tablespoon <time_token_70> <time_token_72> of ginger and we're going to need 4 tablespoons of brown sugar. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Now I'm adding 1 whole onion and just mixing everything up. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> There's not really a specific measurement for the black pepper, it's just up to you <time_token_77> <time_token_77> guys, your preference. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Now I'm going to add 1 teaspoon of bamboo salt. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> Last but not least, the green onion. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> I have just 3 stalks of green onions but it's up to you guys. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> After we've boiled our tofu, we're just going to slice them up into little bite sized pieces <time_token_84> <time_token_85> Ok so we're almost done, I'm just placing the tofu around the plate, you guys don't <time_token_85> <time_token_86> have to do this, I just do it because I think it's pretty and then I'm just going to finish <time_token_86> <time_token_87> off by chopping up some green onions and sprinkling them on top. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> Now it's time to devour this thing. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Ok so now I'm going to use my lettuce and place my pork in there and eat it like so. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> A lot of Koreans use lettuce and they also eat rice but I'm cutting out the rice for <time_token_91> <time_token_91> tonight, I'm just going to eat it with my lettuce and my tofu. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> So what you do with the tofu is you just cut it in half into little bite sized pieces and <time_token_92> <time_token_93> then place a piece of meat on top and eat it like so, there you go, voila! <time_token_93> <time_token_94> Thank you guys so much for watching, I hope you guys enjoyed this recipe. <time_token_94> <time_token_96> If you guys decide to make this, definitely take a picture and

Welcome to Fortune Cooking. Today I'm going to show you how <time_token_1> <time_token_4> to make a noodle soup. It's an Asian wonton noodle soup and we have bok choy, baby bok <time_token_4> <time_token_6> choy. I split it in half and I have eight wonton, the Asian wonton I remake. You can <time_token_6> <time_token_8> check out my wonton a drop soup recipe and already cooked roast pork. You can <time_token_8> <time_token_11> use a pork tenderloin or pork shoulder and cut it like two inches square thick <time_token_11> <time_token_13> strip and just marinate it like just the same recipe that my spare ribs. So and <time_token_13> <time_token_15> also I got garnish green pepper and also I have the dried garlic and the noodle I <time_token_15> <time_token_17> use today is this perfect for the wonton noodle soup. It's zhenhui, egg noodle <time_token_17> <time_token_20> strictly for wonton noodle soup and I show you how to cook. Okay water is boiling, put <time_token_20> <time_token_23> some wonton noodle and I got this really long noodle chopstick, it's like 18 inches, here <time_token_23> <time_token_25> we go. That noodle only cook about two minutes, it's not long, it won't take long. Okay, <time_token_25> <time_token_27> okay about two minutes, the noodle is done. You just put it on your spider <time_token_27> <time_token_30> drainer here and drip it out and put it in your soup bowl, yeah a little bit. That's a, <time_token_30> <time_token_32> that's a spider like strainer strictly for noodle soup. They go like a deeper shape like this <time_token_32> <time_token_34> and if you can get one of those in the future to cooking noodle soup, it's very nice. All right, <time_token_34> <time_token_36> the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add all my wonton, white water still boiling, <time_token_36> <time_token_38> okay and my vegetable, all right and the vegetable I only need to cook for like 30 seconds and I'm <time_token_38> <time_token_39> going to get out the vegetable first and the one time let them cook until done, probably take about <time_token_39> <time_token_41> two to three minutes. Okay, at this point this broth is really good, it's okay you can do this <time_token_41> <time_token_43> and this wonton noodle soup, sometime you can garnish with beside one time you can make shrimp <time_token_43> <time_token_45> one time, pork one time and lots of Asian people would like to put with like fish cake and we can <time_token_45> <time_token_47> put like a beef brisket, all kind ingredient you know so it's no rule you make your own whatever <time_token_47> <time_token_49> you feel like it today but tonight I just want to have some roast pork and some wonton and some <time_token_49> <time_token_52> vegetable with a nice warm stock and the nice noodle soup. Okay, so now it's about 30 seconds <time_token_52> <time_token_54> I'm going to get the vegetable out real quick just like this okay and I put it in my soup bowl <time_token_54> <time_token_57> here too as well and then I'm going to wait until the water boil to cook my wonton, it's very simple <time_token_57> <time_token_58> it's a comfort noodle soup easy to make all right I see you later after three and a half minutes <time_token_58> <time_token_62> my wonton is done and beautiful nice wonton I put it into my soup bowl and then at the meantime <time_token_62> <time_token_65> I have a part of the chicken stock almost ready and some people will just use the same broth that <time_token_65> <time_token_67> they cook with the noodle because the egg noodle they have a very nice and unique taste but I'm <time_token_67> <time_token_69> going to show you how to make the stock okay I have five cups of the chicken stock here it's boiling <time_token_69> <time_token_71> and I just add some marin cooking wine and just a little bit half teaspoon soy sauce okay and <time_token_71> <time_token_73> a little bit drizzle the sesame oil just like this very tiny little bit just give the soup <time_token_73> <time_token_75> more flavor and some people like to put ginger and green onion and all the vegetable stock <time_token_75> <time_token_77> anywhere you like but I like to have my soup plain simple because I have the roast pork they <time_token_77> <time_token_79> give you the little texture of the barbecue flavor and the vegetable is so crispy and <time_token_79> <time_token_81> and bling and the egg noodle soup the noodle actually have a flavor for it so this is done <time_token_81> <time_token_83> all right next I'm going to turn off the broth and I just slowly pour in really nice and hot <time_token_83> <time_token_86> just like this perfect and then I will garnish the green onion okay and then the dry garlic <time_token_86> <time_token_89> right here just like this here you go done some Asian wonton noodle soup excellent here's your <time_token_89> <time_token_91> final noodle soup wonton noodle soup that you can on the side you can have hot chili with some soy <time_token_91> <time_token_93> sauce and you know all the dipping sauce you like with your wonton and the roast pork I just <time_token_93> <time_token_95> going to show you how wonderful how yummy this dish you see that's how you eat it with the soup <time_token_95> <time_token_97> and the noodle and everything else together all right here we go I'm chef Tom thank you <time_token_97> <time_token_98> for watching fortune cooking I see you next time ", "duration": 314.17, "segments": [[59, 81], [83, 100], [113, 117], [166, 180], [187, 193], [201, 235], [261, 280]], "seg_text": "<time_token_18> <time_token_25> <time_token_26> <time_token_31> <time_token_35> <time_token_36> <time_token_52> <time_token_56> <time_token_58> <time_token_60> <time_token_63> <time_token_74> <time_token_82> <time_token_88>", "pure_cap": "boil some water in a pan and add some wonton noodles and stir. remove the noodles. add the wontons and baby bok choy to the water. remove the bok choy leaves. remove the wontons. boil some chicken broth in a pot add some cooking oil soy sauce  and sesame oil. pour broth and garnish with chopped green onions and dry garlic"}, {"image_id": "o42iehActZo.mp4", "caption": "<time_token_23> <time_token_25> place a patty on the bottom bun of the burger <time_token_25> <time_token_29> spread mayonnaise on the top bun <time_token_30> <time_token_33> add lettuce to the top bun <time_token_33> <time_token_36> place two slices of tomato on the lettuce <time_token_37> <time_token_39> place four slices of pickle on the patty <time_token_40> <time_token_43> add ketchup over the patty <time_token_43> <time_token_47> add four slices of onion on the patty <time_token_49> <time_token_51> place the top bun over the bottom bun <time_token_51> <time_token_55> wrap the burger in a paper cover", "id": 248, "seg_prompt": "160 ; 39, 41 ; 42, 48 ; 49, 54 ; 55, 60 ; 61, 65 ; 66, 70 ; 71, 78 ; 80, 83 ; 84, 90..............................................", "asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_4> Wapu was actually introduced in 1957, after which has become the so-called signature product of Burger King. <time_token_4> <time_token_8> We are using 100% pure Australia beef, and all our suppliers are HACCP certified. <time_token_13> <time_token_15> First we inspect the bun, and then we will separate the bun into halves. <time_token_15> <time_token_18> The top half is called the crown, the bottom half is known as the heel. <time_token_18> <time_token_23> And we drop it into the toaster, and once it gets toasted, you place your heel on the target, the crown on the top portion of the wrapper. <time_token_23> <time_token_27> Take one patty and place it on the heel.

<time_token_7> <time_token_7> They call it Italian bacon, but it's not smoked. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> I'm going to saute that over medium heat and a little bit of olive oil until not quite

cloves worth. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> All right, we don't want to brown that, of course. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> So stir that in and just cook that for about a minute. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> All right, after the garlic cooks for about a minute, we're going to dump in our chicken, <time_token_20> <time_token_22> broth, and some water, and one can of plum tomatoes that I crushed with my fingers. <time_token_22> <time_token_24> You could also use, of course, crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, anything you want. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> All right, give that a

beautiful cranberry <time_token_27> <time_token_28> So gorgeous and delicious. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> So to use these, you've got to take them out of the pods, all right, just like shell in <time_token_29> <time_token_31> So I did that, and I had about just over a cup of cranberry beans, also known as shelling <time_token_31> <time_token_32> beans for obvious reasons. <time_token_32> <time_token_32> I'm going to dump those in. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> I'm also going to add some chopped cabbage. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Very classic minestrone ingredient. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> I'm going to spice it up a little bit with some red pepper flakes, some dry Italian herbs, <time_token_35> <time_token_36> and a big pinch of salt. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> All right, I'm going to give that a stir. <time_token_36> <time_token_38> And I'm also going to add a can of drained and rinsed garbanzo beans. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> I really like garbanzo beans in this soup. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> They add just a little bit of extra sustenance and meatiness, and I like them, so I put them <time_token_40> <time_token_41> But really, any canned bean product will work in this. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> All right, when that comes up to a simmer, I'm going to turn my heat down to medium-low <time_token_42> <time_token_43> and I'm just going to simmer that until those cranberry beans are tender. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> It's going to take about 45 minutes. <time_token_44> <time_token_46> And while that's happening, I'm going to prep another critical ingredient, the greens. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> I'm using Swiss chard in this case. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> I have a nice big bunch of Swiss chard washed very thoroughly. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> All right, you can use the stems and the leaves. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> For the stems, simply slice across like that and sort of a small dice. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> For the leaves, I usually just roll them up, roughly chop them. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> I go one way, then I kind of go the other. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> There's no wrong way to slice Swiss chard, so relax. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Okay, so my greens are prepped. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Again, make sure those are thoroughly, thoroughly rinsed. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> We're going to go back over to our soup pot, and you'll notice me adding water here. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Anytime the soup looks like it might be getting a little too thick, add some water. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> We need enough liquid to cook the ingredients, and at the end, we need enough liquid to cook <time_token_57> <time_token_59> Okay, as soon as my shelling beans, my cranberry beans were tender, I'm testing one right there. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> I'm going to dump in my greens, stir those in. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> I'm going to simmer those for about 15 minutes, and we are getting close to being done. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> Look how beautiful that is already. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> And I don't even have the pasta in. <time_token_62> <time_token_65> Speaking of which, we're going to use ditalini, these little mini tubes, the official pasta <time_token_65> <time_token_65> shape of minestrone. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> And I know what you're thinking, that doesn't look like very much. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> There's no way that's enough. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> Oh, you're going to be amazed, like two-thirds of a cup here is enough for this giant pot <time_token_68> <time_token_69> All right, before you add the pasta, very critical, adjust your seasoning. <time_token_69> <time_token_71> I added some black pepper, I tasted for salt, and added more salt. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> All right, so you want the soup to be fully seasoned, especially for salt, when you dump <time_token_72> <time_token_72> in that pasta. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> All right, you're going to dump in the pasta, you're going to turn your heat up to medium <time_token_74> <time_token_75> You want this to be simmering pretty good so the pasta cooks and just doesn't sit in <time_token_75> <time_token_77> And 15 minutes later, as soon as the pasta is tender, you're ready to ladle that into <time_token_77> <time_token_79> some hot bowls and serve this magnificent and big soup. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> I like to finish mine off with some extra virgin olive oil, just drizzle it right over <time_token_80> <time_token_81> You know that one we're telling you never to cook with, to save it to finish things? <time_token_81> <time_token_82> All right, that's the one we want you to use here. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> Also a light dusting of Reggiano Parmesan does not hurt and is highly recommended. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> And then to brighten it up a little bit, add a little freshness and color, some Italian <time_token_85> <time_token_86> All right, don't forget the big hunk of bread. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> And then you're going to dig in to one of the best soups ever invented. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> So comforting, delicious, and relatively healthy for you. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> And like I said, this is made differently every time. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> If you want to put carrot in, put carrot. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> If you have green beans, put green beans in. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> That leftover bell pepper in the bottom of your vegetable crisper, dice that up and throw <time_token_92> <time_token_93> There's no wrong way to make minestrone. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> So I hope you give it a try. <time_token_93> <time_token_95> Head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts, as usual.

So we'll start by <time_token_10> <time_token_12> preparing the onions. Cut each end off, chop them in half and then peel them. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> Then with a sharp knife carefully finely chop them and then set the onions aside <time_token_15> <time_token_17> and now it's time for the carrots. Slice each end off, peel them and then slice <time_token_17> <time_token_18> the lengthways and then finely chop with your knife. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Now that your carrots are ready you need to get a large pan and stick it on the <time_token_21> <time_token_24> top. Then pour in some oil so we can fry. Get your onions and carrots that we <time_token_24> <time_token_26> prepared earlier and then throw them in the pan and fry for about five minutes. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> Then get your beef mince and throw that in the pan as well. Along with a couple <time_token_28> <time_token_30> of major squirts of tomato puree, some lashings of Worcestershire sauce and <time_token_30> <time_token_31> crumble in the beef stock cube. <time_token_31> <time_token_34> Then give everything a stir and keep frying until the mince goes nice and <time_token_34> <time_token_36> brown. And then when your mince sauce looks something like this, boil the <time_token_36> <time_token_38> kettle and pour some water over the top so the contents are just about covered. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> Then give everything one final stir and leave it to simmer for about 40 to 50 <time_token_40> <time_token_42> minutes or until the sauce is thickened nicely. And meanwhile we can start <time_token_42> <time_token_43> preparing the mashed potato. So peel all your spuds and then chop them into <time_token_43> <time_token_47> chunks. When your potatoes are ready, put some hot water on the go in a saucepan <time_token_47> <time_token_48> and then leave them to boil for about 15 minutes. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Once your potatoes are done, get yourself a colander and then pour the potatoes in <time_token_51> <time_token_53> to drain the water. Then put them back in the saucepan, pour in your dash of milk <time_token_53> <time_token_56> and then put in your knob of butter. Then get your potato masher and then mash <time_token_56> <time_token_58> the potatoes so they're nice and smooth, like me. Now once your mince sauce has <time_token_58> <time_token_60> finished shimmering and you've got a nice thick sauce, give it a final stir and <time_token_60> <time_token_61> then take it off the heat. And now it's ready to stick everything into another <time_token_61> <time_token_64> dish. Firstly spoon out your mint sauce into the dish and then level it out so <time_token_64> <time_token_67> it's nice and flat. Now get your mashed potato and spread that on top of the <time_token_67> <time_token_69> mint sauce and I find it's easiest to do if you spoon it out and then use the <time_token_69> <time_token_71> back of a spoon to spread it over and make it nice and flat. Once you have a <time_token_71> <time_token_73> nice uniform layer of mashed potato, get a fork and draw some lines in the top <time_token_73> <time_token_75> and this will help it to crisp up a little easier. Now bust open your packet <time_token_75> <time_token_77> ready salted crisps, crush them between your hands whilst they're still in the <time_token_77> <time_token_78> packet so they're nice and fine and then sprinkle them evenly on the top of the <time_token_78> <time_token_80> cottage pie. And now it's ready for the oven so stick it on about 190 degrees <time_token_80> <time_token_82> and then put the cottage pie in for about 35 to 40 minutes and make sure you <time_token_82> <time_token_84> keep an eye on it to make sure it's not burning and it's crisping up nicely. When <time_token_84> <time_token_85> it's golden brown and it's bubbling at the edges you know it's cooked and it's <time_token_85> <time_token_88> ready to serve. So why not enjoy this cottage pie with your favorite veg this <time_token_88> <time_token_90> winter? Ta-da!

<time_token_6> <time_token_6> Let's see how it goes. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> Okay, so we're going to take our potatoes. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> Now when you do this, it's not an exact measurement thing. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> It's one of these things of you make layers of potatoes and if you're cooking these, go <time_token_9> <time_token_9> ahead and cook some up extra and you can save them. <time_token_9> <time_token_9> Once they're done, you can just throw them in the refrigerator. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> They're fine for a day or two. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> Don't worry about it. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> You're not going to spoil. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> So anyway, this makes a perfectly cooked potato. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> They're not soft enough for mashed potatoes, but they still have a little bite to them. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> And if you follow this method, I'm sure you'll be happy with it. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> So and then you can use these potatoes for, you can do baked potatoes with them. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> You can fry them, whatever. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> So anyway, you're going to need a bunch of salt because what you're really salting is <time_token_14> <time_token_14> It's not an accurate thing. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> And then when they're done, they still will need just a little bit of salt. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> So this gets them almost salty enough. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> What we're going to do, we're going to put water in here and we're going to cover them <time_token_16> <time_token_16> at least one inch. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> I'm going to go about an inch and a half or two inches on these. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> These are a little bit bigger. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> If you're using the real small potatoes, you can go an inch, three quarters of an inch, <time_token_18> <time_token_18> something like that. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> But what's going to happen is whenever these are done boiling, the thermal mass that's <time_token_19> <time_token_19> left from the water and the potato, I think we'll finish the cooking process. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Now you do have to start this ahead of time because when we turn off the heat, we're <time_token_20> <time_token_20> going to let these set for two hours. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> Yes, two hours. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> It's going to take time to get them to boil. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> So you're looking at about two and a half hours to get these potatoes cooked. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Anyway, I'm going to put them on the stove now. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> So I've got them sitting on the stove. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> I'm going to take and put my burner on high and then we're going to bring this to a boil. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> Let's see what we've got going on here. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> It's not a rolling boil, but it's a real good simmer and I do have an electric stove so <time_token_25> <time_token_25> that burner is going to stay hot for a while. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put this lid back on here because we want it to <time_token_26> <time_token_26> hold the heat, turn the burner off and then we'll come back in about two hours. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> So here it is two hours later or a little more than two hours because it's not exactly <time_token_28> <time_token_28> a two hour thing. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> We're going to pour this water off. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> Mix in a little cold water for the sink. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> So now we've got all the water out of there. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> We're just going to let these things sit and cool down a little bit so that I can handle <time_token_32> <time_token_32> So let's start on our batter. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> I'm going to use one teaspoon of baking powder. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Well, I have one cup of self-rising flour in here. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> I'm going to put one teaspoon of baking powder because I want to make sure that this rises <time_token_35> <time_token_36> up and then I'm going to put half a teaspoon of salt in here. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Now you could put more salt or less salt depending on how you like it, but I'm keeping this kind <time_token_38> <time_token_38> We're going to do, after we mix this up a little bit, we're going to put this in the <time_token_38> <time_token_39> refrigerator and let it get nice and cold. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> That's going to take about 10, 15 minutes. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> So we have cold flour, cold bowl, cold beer. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> I've got one cup of beer measured out here and it's going to take a little more than <time_token_41> <time_token_41> that, but one cup is a good starting point. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> So everything's cold and that's a freshly opened beer. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> It'll foam up. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> So we're going to give us a mix. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> Now depending upon your flour, you may need to add more beer or you may not. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> This is looking pretty good. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Now I'm going to put this in the refrigerator. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> You know what? <time_token_47> <time_token_48> I don't want it quite mixed there. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> That's not as thick as I want. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> Last time I did this with a different flour, I had to actually go to one cup of flour <time_token_49> <time_token_50> and a one and a quarter cup of beer. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> I'm going to put a little bit of flour in there. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> There we go. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> That's the thickness I'm looking for right there. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Now we're going to put this back in the refrigerator for about five minutes. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> So now let's make our chips, if you will. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> Now you've got an option to peel these if you want to. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> I'm not going to do that today. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> You could eat that just like it is. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> We're going to take, <time_token_58> <time_token_58> cut these into big, I want them in big pieces. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Now if you wanted to peel these, probably the easiest way to do it would be to take a spoon and peel them. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> Okay, so my oil is coming up to temperature. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> So what I'm going to do is I'm going to start dropping our potatoes in there, <time_token_63> <time_token_63> and we'll start putting some color on these things. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Now you want to handle these pretty carefully because they're fully cooked <time_token_64> <time_token_64> and they'll just break apart if you're not careful with them. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Okay, so my oil is coming up to temperature, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start dropping our potatoes in there, <time_token_68> <time_token_69> and we'll start putting some color on these things. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> Now you want to handle these pretty carefully because they're fully cooked <time_token_70> <time_token_70> and they'll just break apart if you're not careful with them. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> And then whenever they're done, do the color that you want. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Just take them out, put them on some paper towels. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Sprinkle a little salt on them right then as soon as they come out of the oil. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Toss them around in that salt a little bit, and then continue cooking your next batch. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> So when you finish cooking your chips, take your fish, and be careful with it, handle it gently, dip it in your batter. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Remember, everything's cold. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> And we're going to ease this into the oil. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> All right, so now we've cooked our fish on all sides. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> Make sure we've got some nice color all the way around. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Just cut the batter really good, getting these little crunchy bits in here. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> We're going to turn the heat off. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> We're going to take our fish out. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> Let's see how I'm going to do this. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> There we go. I'll plate this up and serve. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> Okay, not being an Englishman. Never been an England. I wonder how it did. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> Oh, I know I was supposed to have malt vinegar on this, but let's just try it plain. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> Potatoes are really good. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> I bet this is hot. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> I need a fork. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> How does that look?

This is a real <time_token_2> <time_token_4> meat lovers pizza and I'm going to be doing this on a stone. So it's stone bake <time_token_4> <time_token_6> just like you get at your local pizzeria. The first thing that we want to do is <time_token_6> <time_token_7> grab ourselves some pepperoni and let's slice that up. <time_token_8> <time_token_10> Here's a little closer view. You can slice the pizza thinly or thick <time_token_10> <time_token_13> whatever way you like. And then the next thing that we need is bacon and what <time_token_13> <time_token_14> I'm doing here is I'm just slicing the bacon up really small so that it's <time_token_14> <time_token_16> gonna so that it's gonna fry up much easier in my frying pan. So let's get all <time_token_16> <time_token_19> that cut up and we'll get that into the frying pan. Alrighty the next step is to <time_token_19> <time_token_20> fry off our bacon in the frying pan and the reason why I'm doing this is that I <time_token_20> <time_token_22> just want to make sure that the bacon is thoroughly cooked. So let's fry that up <time_token_22> <time_token_23> and then we're gonna let it cool. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> Earlier in the day I made a recipe of pizza dough. This is for a thinner crust <time_token_26> <time_token_28> pizza and out of that one recipe of dough I created two dough balls. So the <time_token_28> <time_token_31> first thing we need to do is roll out our dough with the rolling pin. You can <time_token_31> <time_token_32> see that's a really nice dough. You can see the air bubbles, the little air <time_token_32> <time_token_33> pockets in the dough. <time_token_34> <time_token_37> Now I'm gonna flour my pizza peel and I'm gonna pop that on there and what the <time_token_37> <time_token_40> flour is gonna do is gonna it's going to let the the whole pizza slide right off <time_token_40> <time_token_41> the pizza peel or the pizza paddle and it'll slide right onto my baking stone <time_token_41> <time_token_44> with ease. You can either do this with flour or you can use cornmeal which a <time_token_44> <time_token_45> lot of people like but it makes a little bit more of a mess in your oven. So we <time_token_45> <time_token_48> got down the sauce, our cheese and now we're putting on the pepperoni and then <time_token_48> <time_token_50> I'm gonna get some bacon on there. All right let's just get the rest of that <time_token_50> <time_token_52> bacon on and then the pizza is going right on to the stone. The oven is set at <time_token_52> <time_token_54> 500 degrees and I'm gonna let that pizza go for exactly seven minutes and here we <time_token_54> <time_token_56> go only seven minutes later and the pizza is ready. You can actually see the <time_token_56> <time_token_60> air pockets in the pizza showing you how hot that pizza stone is and here's <time_token_60> <time_token_63> the finished product and I'll tell you this is one delicious pizza. So let's cut <time_token_63> <time_token_64> it up and give it a little taste test. <time_token_65> <time_token_69> All right and this is pizza number two and the same thing again pop it on to <time_token_69> <time_token_71> the pizza stone. That pizza stone is very very hot so as soon as the pizza hits <time_token_71> <time_token_73> that stone it starts baking right away and seven minutes later here we have our <time_token_73> <time_token_77> second pizza already done and there we go. As I'm zooming in here you can see <time_token_77> <time_token_79> the air bubble way in the back it's starting to deflate. That just shows you <time_token_79> <time_token_82> how hot the air is inside that pizza and here we have the beautiful finished <time_token_82> <time_token_85> product. This is a great pizza bacon and pepperoni yum yum yum. Anyway so that's <time_token_85> <time_token_86> it for this video so I'll see you next time.

<time_token_44> <time_token_45> The butter around the pan, see that beautiful butter? <time_token_45> <time_token_47> The key to it is a lot of butter as well because that gives it a nice wonderful flavor. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> So now we're going to put our eggs in. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> When we put our eggs in, we're just going to whip them a little bit more before we put <time_token_49> <time_token_50> them in like this and then look at that. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Look at those bubbles. <time_token_52> <time_token_55> Now the key here is as we cook them, we're just going to kind of move on a little bit <time_token_56> <time_token_57> One to the side and one to another side. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Little by little. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> And as we move them little by little, you see the egg starts to form, the scrambled <time_token_60> <time_token_60> egg starts to form there. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> Alright, so here we are, about 20 seconds later here. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> See how everything is coming together? <time_token_67> <time_token_68> The butter is getting nice and soaked up into the egg, which is going to be absolutely <time_token_68> <time_token_69> beautiful and lovely. <time_token_69> <time_token_71> You can even go like this if you'd like, let some in the middle, it doesn't matter. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> You don't even need to flip it. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> The key to it is just going like this, back and forth. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> That's it really. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Look at how beautiful, look at the color of that egg. <time_token_75> <time_token_77> Okay, so we're back and look at the egg now. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> It's almost finished. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> You see that? <time_token_78> <time_token_80> I'm going to give it about another probably 8 seconds because it's going to cook once <time_token_80> <time_token_80> I take it off. <time_token_81> <time_token_84> 4, 3, 2, 1, look at that, look how beautiful and yellow that is. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> And here is the final product here, what you've got here is your lovely scrambled egg. <time_token_88> <time_token_92> If you'd like, put a little salt on top and a little crushed pepper, voila, there you <time_token_92> <time_token_94> Simple as it can possibly be and it tastes absolutely delicious.

Don't worry about it sticking on the bottom, it's all good, and we turn it up. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> And we keep on moving that around a medium-high until it becomes brown. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> Now you can see that the meat is all brown, but still, if you look here, there's too much liquid. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> And I'm going to remove this liquid right now by putting a lid on top and removing this liquid here. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Okay, I removed part of the liquid here, there's still some there, so I'm just going to cook for another three to five minutes <time_token_30> <time_token_30> just to take the rest of the liquid from the bottom. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Now you can leave it if you want, I like to do it this way. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> And now we have 300 grams of beef stock. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Now this is only half, the other half is on the side. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> And try to get the best quality beef stock you can, or just dissolve a couple of cubes into water. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> And now I put that on. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> Give that a nice stir. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> There's liquid on the bottom again, but it's the liquid that I want at this point. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> And now we go back to our vegetables and we put it aside, and we put that all back inside. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> And now we stir that around. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Now how is that cottage pie starting to look so move that around. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> And now I'm going to add about a tablespoon of lean berries, or you can add which is your sauce, whichever one you want. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> And I put, well, about a tablespoon and a half, or what the heck, a little bit more. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> I like it. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Stir that around. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> Boy, is that ever looking good. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> And now the famous, famous pepper, I would say about a teaspoon of pepper, and about a teaspoon of thyme. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> Now you can add more, or you can add less. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> And now you grab the rest of half of the beef stock and you add about one tablespoon of white flour or corn flour. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> And I want you to whisk that really, really well. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> And then I want you to take that and put that into your mixture, just like that. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> How is that starting to look. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Now it's important for the taste test, for salt. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> So you've got a little bit here. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> And remember, again, what I said, this is for you, not for me. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> And we taste it. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> You know, I think it's just perfect. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> I will not add any more salt or anything else. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> Now you can add other herbs and spices you want to here. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> You can add a little bit of hot sauce if you want. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> But I'm just going to make it natural like this and then add the hot sauce later onto my individual plate. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Just in case my guests don't like it that hot. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> So then what I do is I add some parsley. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Now you don't have to put parsley into this recipe because it really doesn't call for parsley. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> But you know something, I like the added nutrients and vitamins that come with the parsley. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> Plus it gives it a nice look. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> So I just put that in. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> But like I said, you don't have to. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> So it's about half a cup of fresh parsley. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> I use coriander. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> That's my favorite type. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> And now we just turn off the heat. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> And we put this to the side and go on to the next stage. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> Okay, we're back. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> I have here about a kilo of potatoes. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> I chose the starch type of potatoes because we're going to make mashed potatoes. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> So they were boiled until they were softened. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> And now we take our handy dandy little masher. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> And we just make one complete circle around. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> Each of them all smashed. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> And now I add about a quarter cup of butter. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> About a teaspoon of salt. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> And again, the famous ground pepper. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> About three quarters of a teaspoon to a teaspoon. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> Whatever you like. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> And now we just move that one more time around. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> Just to get everything mixed. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> Now if you want the potatoes a little bit more soft, just add a little bit of milk. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Depends on your potato. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Depends on how thick you want it. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> For this recipe, I don't want to add any milk. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> I want the potatoes thick. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> And I'll take your handy dandy spoon and give it a good stir. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> That is now ready. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> Here we are. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> I got my baking dish. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> I'm using glass. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> For me it's easier to wash. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> But you can use metal or you can use a lasagna dish too if you want. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> So here it is. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> And now we take our mixture here that we get of the meat. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> And we put that all inside. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> I love the smell of lean berries mixed in with the meat. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> And we just spread that around and try to make that as even as possible. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> This is the way I like to do things. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> And try not to be too perfect in the kitchen. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Because the kitchen is not a place for perfectionists. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> Yeah, that's done. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> And now we take our mashed potatoes and we put that inside. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> Now this recipe is very very special for me. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> It is my recipe. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> And I know it's my recipe because I basically stole it from my friend. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Which he is a chef, a great chef in Cyprus. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Which I will add a link to his restaurant at the end of this video. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> And he's the one that came up with this recipe. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> And like I said, he was generous enough to leave the door open. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> And I went through the door and I took his recipe. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> He might be a little upset with me because after all I did put bacon fat in it. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> And the recipe does not call for that. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> But I like to be a bit of a troublemaker. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> Now at this point you can add cheese to the top if you want. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> I'm not going to add any cheese. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> I like it just the way it is. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Now at this point I like to take my fork. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> And just basically I like to run it like this on top. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> And the reason is for some reason it makes it more crispy. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> And then the size, I just tuck in the size like this. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> And there we have it. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Now my oven is preheated to 325 degrees. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> It is a gas stove. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> And what I'm going to do is I'm going to leave it in there for 40 minutes. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> And we will be back, right out of the oven. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> So what we're going to do now is we're just going to let it cool down for I say about 30 minutes before we cut it. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> Now if you want the top to be a little bit more brown just open the top grill. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> And I just cut it from above. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> But I like it like this. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> Just when the tips start to turn brown because I don't like too much crispness on the top. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> But then again that's what I like, whatever you like. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> And now just to top it off you take some nice parsley and just sprinkle the top like that. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> Now how does that look on your presentation? <time_token_96> <time_token_97> So enjoy and thank you for being with me. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> And I hope to see you again on my next recipe. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> Thank you and goodbye.

<time_token_3> Hey everybody, it's BeVegan and today's video is about probiotics and sauerkraut. <time_token_3> <time_token_3> I just want to give you a little bit of background before I go into the recipe that I'm going <time_token_3> <time_token_3> to share with you. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> A couple years ago I was having issues with my digestive tract and I think actually what <time_token_4> <time_token_5> caused it is I was working somewhere where I was getting really sick all the time and <time_token_5> <time_token_6> so I had gone through a few courses of antibiotics and my stomach was just giving me so many <time_token_6> <time_token_7> problems and I knew a way to fix it naturally was through probiotics but I didn't want to <time_token_7> <time_token_9> use something that was full of animal product so I didn't want to use like a kefir or one <time_token_9> <time_token_10> of those expensive things that they sell in whole foods like in glass bottles. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> It's probiotic which is great but the majority of it comes from milk. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> So I believe that kombucha has great probiotic properties but I was out of town at the time <time_token_12> <time_token_13> and didn't have access to a kitchen so I was not wanting to spend four dollars every single <time_token_13> <time_token_14> day to buy a kombucha. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> So this is something that I kind of through the years have gotten to like and really enjoy <time_token_15> <time_token_15> when I was in Poland. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> I ate like sauerkraut daily if you look at my Instagram. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> I think I was in love with sauerkraut, I put so many pictures up. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> But this is a recipe that we stumbled upon, my husband and I, he's Polish so he introduced <time_token_18> <time_token_19> me to sauerkraut and then I realized after some time that there is actually probiotic <time_token_19> <time_token_19> properties in sauerkraut which is unbelievable. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> So I'm going to show you how to make it but first let me just tell you a couple things <time_token_20> <time_token_21> that are beneficial to know about this vegan source of probiotic. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Fermented vegetables are very rich in lactic acid and along with other natural acids that <time_token_22> <time_token_23> are produced in your digestive system, those help break apart, the sun's disgusting but <time_token_23> <time_token_24> like putrefied food, undigested food that becomes putrefied in your digestive tract. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> So it really helps break that apart and flush it out. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Cabbage and broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables are really good for your system <time_token_26> <time_token_28> They have a lot of fiber, they're actually anti-cancerous and then when you combine the <time_token_28> <time_token_29> cabbage with the probiotic process that happens through fermentation you have these two things <time_token_29> <time_token_30> that just like band-pow together and it really gives your digestive system a cleaning out <time_token_30> <time_token_31> as well as a flushing through to say it for lack of a better term. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> Sauerkraut is something that I have been searching for here in the US trying to find something <time_token_33> <time_token_34> that compares to what I ate in Poland and anything jarred is like just pales in comparison. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> So we wanted to make our own sauerkraut, we wanted to find a recipe that was completely <time_token_35> <time_token_36> pure and so this is the recipe without further ado. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> It has very little ingredients, it's just a head of cabbage which if you can get organic <time_token_37> <time_token_38> cabbage where you live maybe it's three dollars, something like that. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> If you can't find organic cabbage then it's going to be even less than that and I use <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Himalayan salt with it and all you need is some kind of empty glass jar that's cleaned <time_token_40> <time_token_41> very very well and that has some kind of lid on it and honestly that is all you need. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> The cabbage provides its own water over time and the process takes about 5-6 days and it <time_token_43> <time_token_44> is so delicious it actually takes exactly like the cabbage that I've tried in Europe <time_token_44> <time_token_44> and it's fresh and it's raw and it's wonderful. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> So here we go, this is what you need to do to make this sauerkraut in your home. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Number one, 2.2 pounds or 1 kilo of green cabbage thinly chopped. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> I use the food processor, you can use that if you have it, it's not, you can chop it <time_token_47> <time_token_49> Number two, 1.5 tablespoons or 25 grams of good quality salt. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> No table salt, table salt is so bad for you, I could make a whole other video on that. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> I used Himalayan salt, you can also use like Celtic sea salt, any of those are good, good <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Number three is optional, I didn't add it this time but if you'd like to you can add <time_token_52> <time_token_52> two grated carrots. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Number four, you're going to need two big pickle jars or any kind of glass jar that <time_token_54> <time_token_54> has a lid. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> The jars that I used are 30 ounce jars each or what I think would be better although I <time_token_55> <time_token_56> have yet to find a gigantic jar, I think one jar at 60 ounces would be perfect for one <time_token_56> <time_token_56> whole head of cabbage. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Here's what you need to do, chop the cabbage in your food processor or by hand and then <time_token_58> <time_token_59> put it in a big bowl with the salt and leave it uncovered for an hour. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> You want to just mix it together with your hands or with a spoon whatever so the salt <time_token_60> <time_token_61> After some time some water is just going to come out from the cabbage and so you leave <time_token_61> <time_token_61> it there for a full hour and then you mix it again after the hour and you transfer it <time_token_61> <time_token_62> equally between both jars. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> In the jars, once it's in the jars you want to have the top quarter of the jar empty so <time_token_63> <time_token_64> you're only going to fill to cabbage in the jar like three quarters of the way. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> The reason for this is because it's going to rise, liquid's going to come and it needs <time_token_65> <time_token_65> that space for fermentation. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> You're going to mash it down with something, you can use any kind of spoon you have. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> I happen to use a Vitamix, gosh what the heck is that called, I think it's called a tamper <time_token_68> <time_token_68> and that's just what I used. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> And then you place it somewhere at room temperature with the lid on but not screwed on tight. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> You want it to be covered so that junk doesn't get into it just from sitting around all five <time_token_72> <time_token_72> six days but you don't want to close the lid because it'll stop the fermentation process <time_token_72> <time_token_73> and you don't want to put it in the fridge with the lid closed because that also will <time_token_73> <time_token_73> stop the fermentation process. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> To stir or not to stir that is the question. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Some people believe stirring the sauerkraut daily is a good thing and mashing it down. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Some people believe you should just let it sit and do its thing. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> I kind of am in between on those so if it looks like it needs a little stir, I'll stir <time_token_77> <time_token_78> it and place the lid carefully back on. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> Other times I'll let it go a couple days without stirring at all. <time_token_78> <time_token_80> Then you wait for five or six days until it looks good and tasty and then you taste it <time_token_80> <time_token_81> and you see if it's good and if it's to your liking then you can screw the lid on and put <time_token_81> <time_token_82> it in the fridge and if it's not to your liking you can let it sit another day and it's really <time_token_82> <time_token_82> as simple as that. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> And that's it. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> This is the finished product. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> It has completely filled up. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> It looks beautiful. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> The green color that's on the outside of the jar there has turned to a lovely white and <time_token_85> <time_token_86> kind of different shade of green and it's really good. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> Something that I wanted to say that I didn't say earlier is some people use vinegar and <time_token_86> <time_token_87> sauerkraut and it's just not necessary. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> I don't think it's a good thing for you to be ingesting all the time. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> I've heard controversial things about vinegar. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> So I tried to stay away from it except for cleaning my dishes but I don't use any vinegar. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> It's just not necessary and it tastes amazing and let's do a little taste. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> This actually stayed for five days. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> My mouth is watering. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> Okay, try this recipe. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Tell me what you think. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> Tell me if you love

<time_token_33> <time_token_33> That's a chip, man. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> Remember the one I cut? <time_token_34> <time_token_34> Do you remember I said about the same size? <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Well, I have a size complex, and I think they probably do look quite similar. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> So these are going to go into our oil at 140 degrees, because we're going to cook them <time_token_37> <time_token_37> That's not hot. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> For oil, that's quite cool. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> You can do this just in a pan on the stove, if you like. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> Just keep an eye on it. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> Never leave it unattended. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> And they'll cook for about five minutes. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> Meanwhile, we can do our fish. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> So the batter's there. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Now, there is one other secret ingredient, a little bit of vinegar. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> Now, this is in the batter. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> In the batter. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> About a tablespoon or so. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> And that's just enough to give it a crunch. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> If you don't want to use beer, but you can't get hold of beer, you can just use sparkling <time_token_45> <time_token_45> water is another alternative. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Now, those chips are probably cooked, but if we lift them out, we're going to shake <time_token_46> <time_token_47> to get rid of excess oil and then drain them onto our kitchen roll. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> This is once cooked. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> That's once cooked. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> But you can see already, it's cooked, not crispy, but cooked. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> Fry it up to 180 degrees, because that's what we're going to cook our fish in. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> And then we can start actually battering the fish. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> So this is havoc, like sustainable fish. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Make sure you've taken all the skin off and it's bone-free. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> And that's just going to make the batter stick to the fish. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> And then, Baz, if you can just kind of swirl that round in there. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> You don't have to coat it all the way round, so it's all coated. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> And then drip it into the oil and just slowly lower it in so that it starts to set the batter <time_token_59> <time_token_59> before you let go. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Same with the other one. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> So the whole thing's coated. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> There we go, last minute. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> And then give the basket a little bit of a shake and it just stops sticking to the bottom. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> So they need about five minutes. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> Then they can come out and the chips can go back in. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> So it's done, Ben. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> Nice and crispy. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> So pull those out. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> Just let them drain a little bit. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> They look like a couple of fish and chips. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Nice crispy batter. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> And then if our chips go back in there, Jamie, because now it's the twice part of it and <time_token_69> <time_token_70> this will make them nice and crispy. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> There we go. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> So drop those down. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> They will only need a minute, maybe 90 seconds to crisp up. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Meanwhile, over at this side, we can start plating the rest. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> Another classic British thing to always serve fish and chips in newspaper. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Where's the shrimp? <time_token_75> <time_token_75> It's not a hat. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> A hair on it. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Got a nice big bit of fish in there. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> More classic compliments. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> We've got a tartar sauce. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Okay, so that's mayonnaise, capers, gherkin. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> Nice wedge of lemon. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> And have those chips come in on, Jamie. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> They shouldn't need much longer. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> I think, mate. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> They are there. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> Nice and crispy. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> Drain them off. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> There we go. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> Nice sprinkling of salt. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Season at this stage and it sticks to the oil slightly. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Smells of the seaside, yeah? <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Smells and sounds. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Like a seaside. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> They will stuff some of our chips in there. <time_token_85> <time_token_87> So, for everyone who is after something traditionally British, it's our beer-battered haddock and <time_token_88> <time_token_88> There we go. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> Fish and chips. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> See you then. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> Got for a chip. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> A bit of tartar sauce. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> Good squeeze of lemon into that fish as well. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Try my fish's finger. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> Wow, that is amazing. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> Fresh fish flaking. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> Look at that. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> It's not really a true side. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Yeah, it's a bit of a spank, hasn't it?

Let's make the stuffing for the samosa. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Let's take a non-stick pan and put it on the flame. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> I will add some oil to the pan. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> Once the oil is hot, we will add some cumin seeds to the pan. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> Now the oil is hot and the cumin seeds have started crackling. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> I will add the chopped ginger. It gives a wonderful flavor to the samosa. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> At the same time, I will add some chopped green chillies. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> If you don't want to make it very spicy, you can avoid putting the green chillies. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> Now the ginger has become brown.

Today I'm <time_token_1> <time_token_3> going to show you how to make a beautiful delicious creamy seafood <time_token_3> <time_token_6> laksa. Now seafood laksas are one of my favorite foods in the world so I'm <time_token_6> <time_token_7> really looking forward to bringing you this little recipe. Come on let's go and <time_token_7> <time_token_9> see what's in it. Well today I'm going to be using an onion, red pepper or <time_token_9> <time_token_12> capsicum. A couple of tins of coconut milk. I'm using some laksa paste that <time_token_12> <time_token_13> you buy at the supermarket. I'm going to try using the Hokkien noodles although <time_token_13> <time_token_15> you could use two minute or ramen noodles if you wish. And for my seafood <time_token_15> <time_token_17> I'm using these beautiful fresh local prawns or shrimp. Now you can use <time_token_17> <time_token_19> whatever seafood you like or you could use chicken as well but prawns are nice <time_token_19> <time_token_20> and easy and simple so I'm just going to use them. So what I've done is cut the <time_token_20> <time_token_22> capsicum up into fine strips. You don't have to use capsicum but I just like it <time_token_22> <time_token_24> for the color. I've also diced the onions and I have cut the heads off these <time_token_24> <time_token_26> prawns which I'm now going to wash. Now I'm going to leave the shell on them but <time_token_26> <time_token_27> if you did want to peel them please do. Okay so first I'm just going to add a <time_token_27> <time_token_33> little bit of oil. Now I'm going to add the onions and the laksa sauce. Now it's <time_token_33> <time_token_37> time to add the prawns. We're going to cook that for about, oh see that's spicy. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> We're going to cook that for about three minutes. Keep stirring that occasionally. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> After the three minutes we're going to add <time_token_41> <time_token_43> one and a half of the coconut milk and the capsicum. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Just stir that through. Now we're going to turn the heat down once that <time_token_46> <time_token_48> starts to boil and let that simmer for about five minutes uncovered. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> Now if you think that sauce is looking a little bit too thick just add one tin of the coconut <time_token_51> <time_token_53> milk and maybe half a tin of water. Now while that's simmering for five minutes it's time to <time_token_53> <time_token_55> prepare the noodles. Now these noodles are very easy to prepare. It only takes a minute. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> You just need to put them in a bowl <time_token_58> <time_token_59> then cover them with boiling water. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Then you just need to gently separate them using some tongs <time_token_63> <time_token_64> and we'll just let them sit for about a minute. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> Now once that one minute is up we just need to gently drain the water <time_token_65> <time_token_67> from the noodles. Now by the time those noodles are all heated <time_token_68> <time_token_69> the prawns should be nicely cooked and it's time to serve up. <time_token_70> <time_token_73> So now it's just time to pour this mix and fill up that bowl. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> All right well I can't wait to try this one. Let's give it a go. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Oh it's hot. <time_token_80> <time_token_84> Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Sensational. Well it really is that easy to make and it tastes unbelievable. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> Well if you want to impress someone or you just want to warm up on a cold winter's night <time_token_86> <time_token_89> or you just want to try something different give the laksa a go because honestly once you <time_token_89> <time_token_90> have lak you ain't never going back.

<time_token_1> <time_token_3> but the meals have to be great value, simple and delicious. <time_token_3> <time_token_5> Today, I'm out of the kitchen and at a kale farm. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> So today, I'm going to show you a fantastic fresh idea. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> Beautiful Caesar salad with kale. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> Caesar salad is a great way to start using raw kale. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> I'm using fresh green kale, <time_token_10> <time_token_11> but you'll also need sweet crunch lettuce, <time_token_11> <time_token_12> select shortcut rindless bacon, <time_token_12> <time_token_13> select whole-egg mayonnaise, <time_token_13> <time_token_14> fresh Woolies Tabata loaf and lemon. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Click here for the full recipe <time_token_15> <time_token_16> and to add all the ingredients to your trolley <time_token_16> <time_token_16> when you shop online. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> I'm at one of the farms where Woolies grows <time_token_17> <time_token_18> and harvests its kale. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> I've just picked this kale from the fields behind me <time_token_19> <time_token_20> and washed it. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> You can use it fresh, raw in salads, or you can cook it. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Kale's such a versatile vegetable, <time_token_22> <time_token_23> full of fibre, packed full of vitamins, <time_token_23> <time_token_24> and it's available all year round. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> OK, let's get cooking. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> Pick it into bite-sized pieces, add lemon juice. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> Lemon and kale work so beautifully together. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Add some salt. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Get in there and massage the lemon and the salt <time_token_31> <time_token_32> all in to the kale leaves. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> We don't need to cook them. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> The acid in the lemon juice <time_token_33> <time_token_34> is going to really tenderise these kale leaves. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> So the leaves are all beautifully coated <time_token_35> <time_token_36> with the lemon and the salt. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Set it aside and onto the dressing. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> This Caesar dressing is so easy. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> One cup of whole-leg mayo, Dijon mustard, one teaspoon, <time_token_40> <time_token_41> half a lemon. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> It's going to give this Caesar a real zine. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Love anchovies in dressing. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> They add such a beautiful salty flavour. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> One clove of garlic, finely chopped, <time_token_46> <time_token_48> finely grate two tablespoons of parmesan, <time_token_48> <time_token_49> some freshly ground black pepper. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Whisk this all together, along with some water <time_token_50> <time_token_52> to thin it out to the right consistency to coat my leaves. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Don't want it to be too thick. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Pour it into a jar. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> And that's ready. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> I've got some shortcut bacon here, which I'm going to dice. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Heat up your pan so we can get the bacon nice and crispy. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> While that's heating up, I'm going to prepare my croutons. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> I'm using a ciabatta loaf. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> Cut it in half. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> And you remove the crust because we <time_token_62> <time_token_63> want that soft white bread inside to crisp up, <time_token_63> <time_token_64> not the hard crust. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> It's going to let me get perfect nice little crouton squares. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> And when they hit the pan and soak up <time_token_66> <time_token_67> all that beautiful bacon oil, they're <time_token_67> <time_token_68> going to go crispy and golden. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> OK, my pan's ready for the bacon. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Cook the bacon until crispy. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Couple of tablespoons of olive oil. <time_token_73> <time_token_76> And the bacon fat that rendered off when we were crisping it up <time_token_76> <time_token_77> is going to soak in and give it that extra bacony flavor. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> This kale's soaked up all the lemon juice, <time_token_78> <time_token_79> and it's all soft and tender. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> I've got some sweet crunch lettuce. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> And I'm not going to cut this because cutting the lettuce <time_token_80> <time_token_81> bruises it and will make it go brown. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> I'm just going to tear it into the kale leaves. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> What I really love about this salad, it's not just a salad. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> It's like a meal, fresh kale, croutons, crispy bacon, <time_token_86> <time_token_87> shavings of parmesan, and all combined together <time_token_87> <time_token_88> with that gorgeous dressing we made earlier. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Oh, that's perfect. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> All hail the kale. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Caesar salad with kale made fresh on the farm. <time_token_92>

Welcome to my kitchen. Today I am going to show you how <time_token_1> <time_token_2> to make Punjabi famous dish that is Chana Masala. This is one of my favorite dish and <time_token_2> <time_token_4> whenever I go to hotel, I always order Batura and they will serve with Chana Masala and <time_token_4> <time_token_5> I just love to take and here goes the ingredients that you need to make this Chana Masala. Here <time_token_5> <time_token_7> I have a Chana. So I soaked them for 5 hours and fresher cooked for 5 hours and I took <time_token_7> <time_token_8> around 1 cup. It serves around 3-4 people. So cook it in a consistency in which it should <time_token_8> <time_token_10> get mashed well. Here I have 1 onion grater and 1 tsp of ginger garlic and I have 3 tomatoes <time_token_10> <time_token_11> finely chopped and chopped coriander leaves for garnishing. Here is whole Garam Masala <time_token_11> <time_token_13> that is 2 berries, 2 stormies, 1 chana manstek and 3 cloves. Here I have 1 tsp of turmeric, <time_token_13> <time_token_15> 1 tsp of Garam Masala and this is powdered one and I have here is this dry mango powder <time_token_15> <time_token_17> that is Anshu powder and here is some Kitchen King Masala. I use this one while making Chana <time_token_17> <time_token_18> and you can also use cumin powder and coriander powder if you don't have this one and here is <time_token_18> <time_token_19> my peppercorns and fennel seeds. So I always add this while into the oil and here is while <time_token_19> <time_token_20> making Chana Masala. Coming to this Kitchen King Masala you can get it in Indian grocery <time_token_20> <time_token_21> store. If you don't have you can use Chana Masala powder also. So these are all the ingredients <time_token_21> <time_token_23> that you need. So let's see how to make this and I just forgot to say one thing that you <time_token_23> <time_token_25> need. So just take around 15 chana, cook the chana and just smash them using your fork <time_token_25> <time_token_27> or smasher because the reason why I am doing like this is while cooking you will get nice <time_token_27> <time_token_28> aroma of this chana mixed well in your gravy and it gives you a nice flavor in every bite. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> So I always used to do by smashing some of the chanas. So just want to share with you <time_token_29> <time_token_31> so you can do this way to get a yummy chana masala. So don't mash all the chanas that <time_token_31> <time_token_32> smash 10 to 15 chana that is enough and here is my pan on stove. Now I am going to add <time_token_32> <time_token_33> around 3 tbsp of oil. If you are preparing chana masala, you should need to add some <time_token_33> <time_token_35> extra oil. So just forget about your diet and add 3 tbsp of oil and bring them to hot. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> So once it's hot, you can add your whole garam masalas like stormies, gloves, china <time_token_39> <time_token_41> sticks and cardamom. Don't add your bay leaf at first, add these and then once they cooked <time_token_41> <time_token_42> like if you get the nice aroma of this whole makkara masala then you can add your bay leaf <time_token_42> <time_token_44> into this. So it's getting cooked. I am getting a nice aroma of these cinnamon cardamom gloves <time_token_44> <time_token_47> and now I am adding bay leaf. So here goes my ginger garlic paste. At this point of time <time_token_47> <time_token_48> you can also add your pepper corns and fina seeds into the oil but I forgot to show that <time_token_49> <time_token_50> in video. So don't forget to add your pepper corns and fina seeds also that will give you <time_token_50> <time_token_51> a nice flavor in your dish. So my garlic and ginger are finely cooked. Now I have added <time_token_52> <time_token_53> my onion that is grated onion. I always use grated onion while making chana masala so <time_token_53> <time_token_54> that it will nicely smash well and I will get a nice consistency of gravy also. So cook <time_token_54> <time_token_57> this onion in for around 2 minutes so that it turns into nice golden brown. You should <time_token_57> <time_token_58> wait till these onions are nicely turned into golden brown. So to make the process first <time_token_58> <time_token_60> we can add some char malek into this onion so that onion will get cooked soon also. Just <time_token_60> <time_token_61> mix them well and cook them for at least 2 minutes till the raw flavor of onion goes away. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> So once the onions are done you can add your tomato and all the spice powders like garam <time_token_62> <time_token_64> masala, grana masala that is kitchen king masala and dry mango powder and salt also. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> So now I am done with my onion. So now I will add tomato, garam masala, kitchen king masala <time_token_65> <time_token_67> mango powder and cook this tomato till they nicely mash. You can see I have got a nice <time_token_67> <time_token_68> gravy with those tomatoes. So once they are nicely cooked you can add your mashed chana <time_token_69> <time_token_69> chana into this <time_token_70> <time_token_70> and then add your whole chana. This is a pressure cooked one. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> You can also use a microwave oven to cook this chana <time_token_71> <time_token_74> and so chana is done. So now we need to cook this gravy for at least 15 minutes. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> That's how you will get a nice taste in your chana masala. If you go asturant they will <time_token_75> <time_token_76> always cook this masala for at least half an hour and more than that not less than that. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> That's why you get a very nice flavor in your asturant. So now I will cook this for at least <time_token_77> <time_token_78> 15 minutes and then show you. So now it's been 15 minutes. Chana masala is cooking <time_token_78> <time_token_79> and now I have got a nice thick sauce of chana masala. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> See so what I am going to do is now after this 15 minutes again I used to keep this <time_token_81> <time_token_83> chana masala in a low flame for one more 10 minutes. So that the gravy will be even more <time_token_83> <time_token_84> thick and I will get a nice flavor of chana masala. Chana and this masala mingled well <time_token_84> <time_token_85> and it's really taste amazing. So cook it for 15 minutes first in medium flame and 10 minutes or <time_token_85> <time_token_87> 15 minutes in low flame. So and add your coriander leaves in this mixed dandel and you are done with <time_token_87> <time_token_89> your Punjabi special chana masala. See how nice it is. So here is my chana masala ready to eat. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> So you can serve this one with chapati or puri, patura, naan, everything. This will taste great <time_token_91> <time_token_93> and so friends this is how you can make Punjabi special dish chana masala at your home. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> So hope my videos helps you to make tasty chana masala.

<time_token_2> By request, I am gonna teach you how to make cheater pot Thai. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> Pot Thai is one of the most popular noodle dishes in Thai cuisine. <time_token_4> <time_token_7> It is so easy to make with a cheater sauce, but it is so easy to get wrong. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> So I'm gonna show you in this video some of the tips to make sure that you can <time_token_9> <time_token_9> make perfect pot Thai. <time_token_9> <time_token_11> Authentic pot Thai sauce from scratch requires tamarind paste, <time_token_11> <time_token_12> which is really hard to find in regular grocery stores. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> So I'm gonna teach you how to make really good tasting pot Thai from <time_token_14> <time_token_15> pre-made jar pot Thai sauce. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> We're making shrimp pot Thai, so I've got shrimp here. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> I also have an egg, scrambled the egg in a small bowl, and <time_token_19> <time_token_19> then I've got lots of garlic. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Now this is my vegetables. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> I've got snow peas and bean sprouts. <time_token_21> <time_token_24> And this, my friends, is the magical pot Thai sauce, dried rice noodles. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> I found these at my regular grocery store as well. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> We're using dried rice noodle, and <time_token_26> <time_token_27> the first thing you have to do is soak the dried rice noodle in hot water. <time_token_27> <time_token_29> Just squish it all in there and make sure all the noodles are submerged. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> I put a bowl on top of it just to keep all the noodles in the water. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> Okay, for the snow peas, I want you to cut them diagonally lengthwise. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> So they look just like this. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> So after soaking the rice noodles for ten minutes, they should look like this. <time_token_35> <time_token_37> Softer, they're still a little hard, but they are ready to be drained. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> And we're gonna get ready to do the stir fry. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Heat a wok, or the largest pan you have, and go ahead and <time_token_39> <time_token_41> heat it up until very hot, and we're gonna cook the shrimp. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> You want to cook the shrimp on both sides just about halfway, so <time_token_42> <time_token_43> a minute on each side is good. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> You don't wanna fully cook the shrimp. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> We're gonna add the shrimp back into the pot a little later. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> But stir frying them halfway does something very important. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> If one, it makes sure you get a nice sear on the outside. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> And number two, it makes sure you don't overcook the shrimp. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> After you take your shrimp out, your halfway cooked shrimp, <time_token_50> <time_token_52> you're going to just leave your pot on and add in your egg. <time_token_52> <time_token_54> And you can just scramble the eggs until the eggs are just set. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Again, you don't want to overcook the eggs either. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> So go ahead and put those in the same bowl as the shrimp. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> And now we're gonna add some garlic. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> I turned down my heat just a bit because I'm adding garlic. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> I don't wanna burn the garlic. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> Add in my vegetables, give it a good stir fry for just about 30 seconds or so. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> Once you start smelling the garlic, time to add in the pot tie sauce. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> And now it's time to add in your drained rice noodles that have been soaking. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Just add everything to it. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> It makes it so much easier. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Pick everything up, move it around. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> You want the sauce and all the vegetables to distribute well. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> And guess what? <time_token_70> <time_token_71> It's time to add back in the half cooked shrimp and the egg. <time_token_71> <time_token_73> Give everything a good toss with your tongs. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> That empty jar of pot tie sauce, well, I added a bit of hot water to that, or just water. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> I shook it around because I want every single bit of that sauce. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> I'm just gonna add that back in. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Let that cook for a couple minutes and that's it. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> You are done. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> I top it off with some chopped peanuts. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> Add some fresh cilantro on that. <time_token_80> <time_token_83> Serve it with a wedge of lime if people like to have just a little more tang to the dish, <time_token_83> <time_token_83> but you are ready to serve. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> That was less than 10 minutes of cooking time. <time_token_85> <time_token_87> Super easy to make and make sure you, number one, soak your rice noodles in hot water and <time_token_87> <time_token_88> that'll help you prevent overcooking of the rice noodles later. <time_token_88> <time_token_90> And two, make sure you cook your shrimp first and take them out when they're just halfway <time_token_90> <time_token_92> cooked and that will help you make sure that your shrimp are perfectly cooked.

<time_token_1> We have had absolutely loads of requests for some vegan recipes, so whether you're vegan <time_token_1> <time_token_2> or not, trust us, you're going to love this one. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> So obviously vegan food is all about cooking with ingredients that don't come from animals, <time_token_5> <time_token_6> so that's not just meat, but animal products as well, and today we're going to do falafel <time_token_7> <time_token_8> So that's based around chickpeas, and then we're adding to it onion, lime, some fresh <time_token_8> <time_token_9> herbs, spices, loads of flavours, and we'll serve it with a couple of dips and some toasted <time_token_10> <time_token_10> They're awesome stuff, can't wait. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> Now, we need to blend lots of ingredients up, if you haven't got a blender you can just <time_token_11> <time_token_12> mash them all up with a fork, but to be honest with you, we're going to save all that hassle. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> Chickpeas go in there, and to that if you can add some of our herbs, so coriander and <time_token_14> <time_token_15> parsley, and then if you can crush the clove of garlic, meanwhile I'm going to chop up <time_token_16> <time_token_17> The beauty about all of these ingredients is that none of them need a fridge, okay? <time_token_17> <time_token_18> So it's the kind of thing that becomes great festival food as well, it's the thing you <time_token_18> <time_token_19> can mash up in a bowl in the middle of a field. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> Did you give you some of the barbie? <time_token_19> <time_token_21> You might still need to put a pan on there first, because they're quite delicate, but <time_token_21> <time_token_21> a pan on a barbie were just the same, wasn't it? <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Because we're blending it up, it doesn't have to be too fine, so if you can throw those <time_token_22> <time_token_23> in there as well, Baz? <time_token_23> <time_token_24> So my auntie is a vegan, she's been asking for one of these recipes for ages now, she's <time_token_24> <time_token_25> been going on and on with me about it. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> Well there we go, hopefully this will please your auntie. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> There you go auntie. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> So we need a couple of spices to go in here as well, so we need some chilli powder, about <time_token_27> <time_token_27> a teaspoon of that. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Give it a kick, and of course you can add as much as you want, but add some, taste it, <time_token_28> <time_token_28> you can always add more later on. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> A little bit of ground cumin goes in there, and then the sort of zing comes from a lime, <time_token_30> <time_token_32> so if you can give that a good roll, that really softens it up, which means you get <time_token_32> <time_token_33> a lot more juice out of it, and then we just cut it in half and squeeze as much of that <time_token_33> <time_token_34> into there as possible. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Now our chickpeas are quite dry, but we are adding that lime juice and a little bit of <time_token_35> <time_token_37> Now sesame is the flavour you associate with hubris, like a tahini paste, and the little <time_token_37> <time_token_38> bit of that, like so, but because we've added those two liquids, we are going to compensate <time_token_38> <time_token_38> with a bit of flour. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> So about two tablespoons of plain flour goes into our mix, there's one, there's two, yeah <time_token_40> <time_token_40> it makes it easier to mould. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> All you need to do now Baz is put the lid on, and blend it away. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Awesome, take it off, give it a quick season, plenty of salt and pepper, we've already <time_token_44> <time_token_45> got that chilli powder in there, but we've got the season beyond that. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> Can we taste it yet? <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Well because it's all raw we can, but just give it a quick taste here to see how much <time_token_47> <time_token_47> chilli we want. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> No, that's not right. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Actually the fresh herbs really lift that as well, it's nice. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> And now we need to mould it. <time_token_52> <time_token_54> Now falafel can be made into any shapes, patties or saucy shapes, we're going to go for balls. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> The golf balls size pieces, you take them out, squeeze it, because you will get some <time_token_55> <time_token_57> sort of moisture come out of that, get a good squeeze, and then what's left just kind of <time_token_57> <time_token_57> roll into a ball. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Try and make them all the same size, but as ever size doesn't matter. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Your balls are bigger than mine. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> This is much easier with clean wet hands actually, if you're damping your hands with four, sometimes <time_token_61> <time_token_63> So there we go, those all pretty much roll, so quick rinse your hands, hot soap and water, <time_token_63> <time_token_64> and now we can start to cook them. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> Now you can bake these, or as you said before, a barbecue would work, but we're going to <time_token_65> <time_token_67> fry them, so a little bit of oil in a pan, and then we just pop our balls into the pan, <time_token_68> <time_token_69> and then you should get a nice sizzle, and if you compact them enough they should all <time_token_69> <time_token_70> hold their shape, so while these cook through for a few minutes, turning them every so often, <time_token_70> <time_token_72> we can put our pita bread into the toaster to warm those through, and then we can serve <time_token_72> <time_token_73> a whole lot with some dips, and we'll have falafel ready. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> So there we go, some pita that's nice and warm, now you can stack that up on one side <time_token_75> <time_token_77> of our plate, we've got a pepper and tomato dip and a taziki dip, some fresh flavours <time_token_77> <time_token_79> there, and then, moment of truth, our falafel balls will make a little bit of a pyramid <time_token_79> <time_token_82> game here as we stack them up, presentation is everything, a little bit like alfredo roche <time_token_82> <time_token_84> tower, because this is a real treat. So there we go, some warm toasted pita, a couple of <time_token_84> <time_token_85> dips, and most importantly, our vegan falafel balls, sorted. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Wow, that's got rich flavours aren't it actually, oh I like the spice, the spice is good, have <time_token_90> <time_token_92> a dunk.

Why grated? <time_token_15> <time_token_15> Because that is the easiest way to process an onion. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> Of course to puree it is even easier <time_token_15> <time_token_16> but since we are using pureed tomatoes we need not use pureed onions. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Because you need that little bite or you need that little chunk in the chicken curry. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> So onions we have grated <time_token_17> <time_token_18> and tomatoes we have used nice bright red ripe tomatoes <time_token_18> <time_token_18> which we have pureed. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Puree is very simple. Just cut the tomatoes, cut the eye of the tomato <time_token_18> <time_token_19> pour the cut into two to three pieces and blend it in the mixi. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> So you have this tomato puree and you have the onions. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> So first of all we will first take oil in a non-stick pan. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> I prefer to work in a non-stick pan because it really saves the efforts <time_token_21> <time_token_21> and secondly nothing really sticks to the bottom of the pan <time_token_21> <time_token_22> so you are not really worried about your chicken curry or any other preparation getting burnt. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> Unless you really leave it in the pan for hours and forget totally about it <time_token_23> <time_token_23> nothing like this is going to happen here. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> So once you add oil to this we will add some whole spices. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> In whole spices we will be using cinnamon, cloves and green cardamom. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Indian preparations or Indian curries are quite flavourful with whole spices as well <time_token_25> <time_token_26> and these ingredients impart a lot of flavour to the curry <time_token_26> <time_token_27> but you don't need to add lots of it may be a small piece of cinnamon, green cardamom and some cloves. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> So as you add this to the oil you will automatically get a very nice aroma <time_token_28> <time_token_28> and this will be there in the curry all the while. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> So it is very important to add whole spices <time_token_29> <time_token_29> and then there is something that is known as garam masala powder <time_token_29> <time_token_30> which is a powder or a masala which is made by grinding whole spices <time_token_30> <time_token_31> not just these three a lot of other and they are lightly roasted and then they are powdered. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> So this is a garam masala which is generally used in all Indian preparations across India. <time_token_32> <time_token_32> So after you have added the whole spices add onion. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Now what happens is after you grate onion it kind of leaves water like this. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> So try and squeeze out this excess water because if there is water in the onion <time_token_34> <time_token_35> which means it will take a while to brown and in the chicken curry you need nice brown onions. <time_token_35> <time_token_35> So just squeeze out this excess water like this. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> So when you squeeze out this water browning happens faster. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> And you add it to this oil and you start sauteing this till the onion starts browning. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> Now sometimes what happens is while sauteing you will observe that the oil has already got absorbed by the onion <time_token_38> <time_token_38> because initially we had not added lot of oil. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> You can easily go on and on with this much oil as well if you are quite calorie conscious. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> If you think you can easily carry it off by adding some more oil you could add it here <time_token_40> <time_token_40> or in this case if you were to make it with very less oil <time_token_40> <time_token_41> you have to keep on sauteing this till the onion starts browning. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> Once onion starts browning we will add the other ingredients. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> All the other spices shouldn't be added before the onion browns <time_token_42> <time_token_43> because once you have added everything else onion will not brown it will only stay white. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> But since we want the onion to brown we will not add anything right now. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> What is basically browning of onion? <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Onion has got a lot of sugar and when it comes in contact with heat like this it caramelizes. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> And that is why brown onions always taste sweet. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Since the sugar has got caramelized it tastes sweet and it also turns golden brown. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> So that is a very simple logic behind browning of onions <time_token_46> <time_token_47> and of course it also gives a very good flavor to the curry. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> Most of the biryani's you see have brown onion as garnish <time_token_47> <time_token_48> is only because it gives good look at the same time it also tastes nice. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> And in case of chicken curry we have to brown the onion <time_token_48> <time_token_49> because in case of onions like this it stays quite raw it doesn't give a good mouth feel. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> So once you brown the onions it really gets combined with all the gravy <time_token_50> <time_token_51> and it doesn't separate from the gravy. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> You will always notice if onions are left raw as in if they are not really sauteed well <time_token_51> <time_token_52> they will always separate as in you will have a tomato on one side <time_token_52> <time_token_52> and you will have the onions on one side. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> So it is always important to saute the onions to an extent that it starts browning. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Ok so you see the onion has already started browning. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Now is the time to add other spices. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> We will first start off with ginger garlic paste. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> After you add ginger garlic paste we will now add turmeric powder. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> We will add red chilli powder. Red chilli powder would depend upon the kind of spicy food you eat at home. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> We will add some cumin powder and some coriander powder. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> Now after you add the whole spices there are chances that it may burn. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> So you may add very little water and just mix this. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Or else the spices would have all got burnt since there was very little oil that we had used in the masala. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Ok so now this needs to be sauteed for about a minute. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> After you have done this we have to now add tomatoes and tomatoes are in pureed form. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> So we have pureed the tomatoes we will add all of it here. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> You see after you add the tomato puree the colour changes and it goes nice and bright red. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> Now in this case if the tomatoes were not red this would not have looked very good. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> This would have given an insipid look and apart from that the red chilli powder also that we have used is the Kashmiri one which is not very spicy and it imparts good colour. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> So as far as possible try and use Kashmiri red chilli powder and bright red tomatoes. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> So this way you will have a very good nice bright red chicken curry. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Now after we have added the tomatoes we will now add salt. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Salt should also be added soon after the tomatoes because that way the tomatoes cook faster. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> Because once we add salt to tomatoes it automatically leaves all the moisture and once all the moisture in the tomato is evaporated the tomatoes are done. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> So here the actual cooking happens where the tomatoes have to cook. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> As in tomatoes if they are left raw the chicken curry does not taste too good. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> So onion has to brown and tomatoes have to cook well. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> So these two things if they happen properly the chicken curry is a hit. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> So while your tomatoes are getting sauteed you can actually get the flavour of the tomatoes which are slightly raw. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> And after a while once the oil starts separating you will automatically come to know what I mean by cooking of tomatoes. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> So right now we have to saute this for some time till the actual raw flavour of tomato goes off. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Ok so now that the tomato is done you can see little little specks of oil which are seen on the sides like this. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> So which means the tomato has already left the oil and it's now time for us to add the chicken. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> So we have chicken which we have used on the bone. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> So all of this in this after which we will add little salt. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> We have already added some salt to the tomatoes so you should keep that in mind and not add excess. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> In that case the chicken curry will go quite salty. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Right now we will add some coriander as well because fresh coriander when you add it in the gravy it imparts very good flavour. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> So after this just mix this nicely. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> Now don't add any water right now because chicken also has a lot of moisture in it and it will also leave all the moisture and giving the curry the required consistency. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> So just mix this in like this. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> We will add some garam masala powder here. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> This is available in most of the grocery stores. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Once again we will mix this. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> If needed we will add water but that would be towards the end and water whatever that you add to the curry will have to be hot. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> Because if you add cold water here the temperature of the gravy will go low and the chicken may go tough. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> So it's very important to add hot water to any curry. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> So let's mix this well. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> Yeah that's perfect. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> And after we have mixed this we just going to cover it and let this cook. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> Now chicken curry doesn't take very long to cook it will take somewhere around 20 minutes. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> And so we will cover this on medium heat for 20 minutes and by the end of it chicken curry will be ready. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Okay so you see the chicken curry is almost done. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> I can see the gravy thickening at the same time the chicken also looks cooked. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> Okay so all of this looks perfect. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Now if you feel that the curry is thick which even I feel what we can do is we will adjust it by adding some water. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> But after you add water you will have to just give it a boil so that it mixes well and that's it. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Then don't further hook it because again it's going to thicken. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> As far as the curry is concerned this is done. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> We will garnish this with some more coriander just like this and it's good to go. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> If it's thick like this you can serve it with nice parathas which I have already shown you. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> Or you can make the simple boiled rice and serve it with that. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> It is just amazing to have hot chicken curry and a bowl of plain steamed rice. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> Make this recipe just the way I have made it and you will be very proud of yourself.

taste. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> The first step is to prepare the beans and dal, soak rajma and urad overnight. <time_token_24> <time_token_27> Now if you decide to make all of a sudden just like me, I use rapid soak method and I am going to show you how to do that. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> So basically you will need at least two to three hours even for this rapid soak method. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> But most of the time I prefer to soak them overnight. <time_token_29> <time_token_32> Wash all the beans and dals and soak urad and rajma overnight or I am going to show you rapid soak method. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Alright so urad and rajma is washed very well. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> So for rapid soak method bring water to boil. <time_token_35> <time_token_35> Water has come to the boil. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Add urad and rajma. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> Turn off the stove. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> Cover it and let it soak. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> So after two and a half hours you can see that beans and black grams are soaked nicely. <time_token_39> <time_token_41> So now I am going to turn on the stove again on a medium to high heat. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Now ready to add chana dal. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Chana dal does not take too long to cook so I do not even soak. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> So I washed it and ready to add mango grams. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> And I am going to cover this time this pressure cooker. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> And I am going to hear about eight to ten whistles. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Alright so the rajma and urad, beans and black grams is taken care. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> Now I am going to work on gravy. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Add about one tablespoon of butter. <time_token_50> <time_token_52> Add cumin seeds, jeera, pinch of asafoetida, tea, this is optional, turmeric powder, haldi, <time_token_53> <time_token_53> ginger and garlic. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> Give it a quick stir. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Keep the temperature on a medium heat. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> Saute the onion for a little bit. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Onion, ginger and garlic are fried nicely. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> So at this point I am going to add tomato puree. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> Now cook tomato puree. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> Cover and let it cook. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Now let's check on our beans and urad and look at them. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Looking at them I can see that they are boiled nicely. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Coming back to tomato, onion and everything. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Alright so this is done. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> Tomato is cooked as well. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> You can see that it has got now that red color at this point. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Ready to add now. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Rajma and urad. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Red kidney beans and black gram. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> I am going to add water. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> You see that all the water was absorbed by beans and urad. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> The aroma is already so wonderful here. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Now ready to add all the spices. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Red chili powder, Lal mirch, garam masala. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Now it's time to make it rich by adding cream. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> About quarter cup so I am just going to eyeball here. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Rich, creamy, delectable dal makhni. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Look at the color even. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I am going to cover it one more time and just cook for about a minute or two minutes. <time_token_79> <time_token_81> And it will absorb all the flavors and the color will slightly change as well. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Alright so the dal makhni is ready and ready to serve. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Serve with naan, roti, paratha or rice. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> I am going to take out dal makhni into this serving bowl here. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> So into this serving handy. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> Garnish with cilantro, dania. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> And because this is makhni butter, makhkan on top. <time_token_88> <time_token_90> You can also smear just a little bit of cream on the side like this. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> And I am serving this dal makhni today with lachha paratha. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Slice off lemon, give it a taste to this makhni. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Nice and rich, creamy and flavorful. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> So this was all about preparing dal makhni. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Thank you for watching and I will see you soon with another great episode of cooking.

If you set it wider, it will make the piece longer. <time_token_67> <time_token_75> The width and the thickness of the trimmed block are not always even all the way to the end, so you need to continually adjust the angles as you work. <time_token_77> <time_token_82> Make the initial cut using the full length of the blade from the heel to the tip in one motion. Once the knife almost reached the skin side, stand at the blade to cut straight down. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> This motion creates a deeper cutting edge which looks nicer. <time_token_91> <time_token_94> The more you practice, the more evenly you will be able to cut off each slice of piece.

basically called bangers and <time_token_1> <time_token_2> mash which is mashed potato and sausages. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> I'm also going to do a little bit of onion just to go with it so here we go. <time_token_4> <time_token_4> I think the first thing is choose your potato. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> Some are better for mashing than others but generally you can use pretty much most potatoes. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> Have a look on the packet if you're unsure. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> Some say they're for mashing and some don't. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> Ok, I've peeled my potatoes, now what we want to try and do is to get these to cook evenly <time_token_8> <time_token_9> throughout the potato so you don't get these lumpy bits. <time_token_9> <time_token_11> Now one way of ensuring that is just pick the middle and chop that up like so and again <time_token_11> <time_token_12> same on that one, do it in the middle for all of those, didn't quite do that on the <time_token_12> <time_token_13> So what I'm going to do is, I wouldn't chop them up any more than that otherwise they <time_token_13> <time_token_14> absorb too much water so chop them down the middle, pop them in the pan and then we're <time_token_14> <time_token_15> going to boil them, slowly boil them for about 15-20 minutes, probably about 20 minutes. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> Ok now for the cooking, I've boiled the kettle, got some malt water in there, saves a bit <time_token_17> <time_token_19> of time so we're just going to fill that up, put some salt in, I think it helps to break <time_token_19> <time_token_20> down the potato and adds a little bit to the flavour so put that in, we're going to tip <time_token_20> <time_token_21> the water away so that's fine, pop the lid on, turn the heat on and we're going to cook <time_token_21> <time_token_22> it simmer I would say, sort of middle heat for about 15 minutes. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> While we're cooking the potatoes in the back there, I've moved them to the back, we're <time_token_23> <time_token_25> just going to put in the sausages, try and pick really nice sausages because you know <time_token_25> <time_token_26> at the end of the day it's half the meal really the sausages so try and pick the good ones, <time_token_26> <time_token_27> get them from the butchers or you know there's various makes out there that are really nice, <time_token_27> <time_token_28> just try what you want, so pop them in the oil, obviously you can grill these if you're <time_token_28> <time_token_30> a little bit more health conscious, you haven't got to you know fry them but it's probably <time_token_30> <time_token_31> easier so what I'm going to do is just pop the lid on those and I'm going to turn them <time_token_31> <time_token_32> over, get them nice and brown on the ice outside, now probably only going to take about 10 minutes <time_token_32> <time_token_33> in total, again turn the heat down not too high, just want to brown them we don't want <time_token_33> <time_token_35> to cook them to death, so there's your bangers, there's your mash, ok now we've got the <time_token_35> <time_token_36> sausages on, the next thing we've put on, we've got a frying pan here is for your onions <time_token_36> <time_token_37> so what we want to do is chop them up, ok we've got the onions all chopped, two onions <time_token_37> <time_token_39> I've used, we've got the oil, turn it up a little bit to make sure it's nice and hot <time_token_39> <time_token_40> and then what we're going to do is just pour in the onions, now you can cook those either <time_token_40> <time_token_41> until they've caramelised which is slightly brown on the outside which is probably what <time_token_41> <time_token_42> I'm going to do or you can cook them a little bit less, now you're at a 10 minute stage <time_token_42> <time_token_43> a quick test and it's a really good one, it's just to stick a knife in if you can get <time_token_43> <time_token_45> it in and see if the potatoes are done, these are clearly not done, 10 minute mark, probably <time_token_45> <time_token_46> another 10 minutes I'd say but I'll check them just before then, ok we're at the 15 <time_token_46> <time_token_47> minute mark now, I'm just going to check these potatoes, yeah they're just slightly falling <time_token_47> <time_token_49> off, what you want to do with the potatoes is slightly overcook them rather than under <time_token_49> <time_token_50> overcook them otherwise you get the lump, so 5 more minutes, so 20 minutes for the potatoes <time_token_50> <time_token_51> and I think we're done and then we're going to add the perfect mash, ok we're at the 20 <time_token_51> <time_token_52> minute stage and I think the potatoes are done now so we're just going to check that, <time_token_52> <time_token_53> if you put the knife in they definitely fall off, if they're hesitant they're not quite <time_token_53> <time_token_54> done, so what I'm now going to do is drain as much water out as possible, I'm probably <time_token_54> <time_token_55> going to use a lid for that and just tip it away down the drain, we're not going to use <time_token_55> <time_token_56> that water for anything at the moment, ok I've put the potato back on the hob which <time_token_56> <time_token_58> is, I mean I've actually got it turned off, so it's really nice and hot now, now what <time_token_58> <time_token_59> we want to do with the potato is just gently chop it like so and then we're going to add <time_token_59> <time_token_61> a little bit of butter and mix it all up basically, so it's all pretty straight forward, now what <time_token_61> <time_token_62> we can do is add a little bit of salt again to the whole mixture, a little bit of pepper <time_token_62> <time_token_65> like so, obviously add that to taste and then we're going to pop in a little bit of butter, <time_token_65> <time_token_66> now if you're a bit health conscious obviously you can use a little bit less, I know some <time_token_66> <time_token_68> of you out there are, but I'm just going to put that in like so and just gently kind of <time_token_68> <time_token_69> mix it all together and try and get as many of those lumps out as possible and then I'm <time_token_69> <time_token_71> going to use one of these, these are great, they make your job easy, if you haven't got <time_token_71> <time_token_73> one of these you can mix it by hand, don't worry if you spill a bit on the edges and <time_token_73> <time_token_74> we're on, it's looking good now, looking good, try and get as many of those things out, now <time_token_74> <time_token_75> the important thing is when you're mixing mashed potato you don't want to keep mixing <time_token_75> <time_token_76> and mixing and mixing because otherwise it ends up starting to be like glue almost, you <time_token_76> <time_token_78> know, now if you like your mashed potato a little bit creamier, I personally do but not <time_token_78> <time_token_79> too creamy, you can add a little bit of milk, again any sort of milk, semi-skim, skinned <time_token_79> <time_token_80> whatever you've got, don't go overboard you can always add a little bit more after, but <time_token_80> <time_token_82> it makes it much more creamy, I know my children like it more creamy, but that's really nice <time_token_82> <time_token_84> as we've got it there, lovely, now there's a lot of things you can add to any mashed <time_token_84> <time_token_86> potato, personally I prefer the chives actually, there we are, nice fine fresh chives and you <time_token_86> <time_token_87> can add some of those with it, put that on a plate and eat it, there we've got it, mashed <time_token_87> <time_token_89> potato, this one's got chives on it, you can just pop a couple of nice sausages on top <time_token_89> <time_token_91> there like so, and I've got a little bit of vegetable, just got a little bit of cabbage <time_token_91> <time_token_92> there, I like a bit of cabbage himself but obviously you can have peas or whatever you <time_token_92> <time_token_95> like and finally got a little bit of caramelised onion, always goes well like so, and then we <time_token_95> <time_token_96> can just put a little bit of gravy on it and you've got a fantastic meal, so obviously <time_token_96> <time_token_97> put it is, and if you like a little bit more pepper you can put it on as you want, that <time_token_97> <time_token_98> is fantastic food.

Today we're going to make some fried calamari. We're gonna need <time_token_2> <time_token_4> a pan of calamari, if you want the tentacles also or just calamari, a teaspoon of black <time_token_4> <time_token_7> pepper, a teaspoon of seasoning. This is half salt, half garlic. If you're in the US you <time_token_7> <time_token_11> can get the Goya, which is good. About 2 cups of oil, 2 cups of flour. And to serve <time_token_11> <time_token_13> it we're gonna need a little, some lemons and Tabasco sauce, which is good, but you <time_token_13> <time_token_16> can use tartar sauce or any sauce you like for seafood. So let's get started. Okay so <time_token_16> <time_token_18> for our flour we're gonna mix the seasoning and the pepper. We're gonna put it in the <time_token_18> <time_token_20> flour and we're gonna mix it together until it's well combined. And after that we're gonna <time_token_20> <time_token_24> cut the calamari in about a quarter inch or half centimeter thick, like this. You just <time_token_24> <time_token_27> need a sharp knife and that's it. So you're gonna cut them just like this, very easy. <time_token_27> <time_token_29> And for the tentacles we're not gonna do nothing to them because they already came clean and <time_token_29> <time_token_31> everything in the package. So this they're gonna stay like this. And so now that you <time_token_31> <time_token_33> have cut the calamari, I have already the flour ready. So we'll try to keep the calamari <time_token_33> <time_token_36> wet and we're just gonna drop them in the flour and just cover them with flour as much <time_token_36> <time_token_39> as you can. And after that, after you see they're all covered from both sides here and here. You're <time_token_39> <time_token_41> just gonna take them out of the flour, try to take the excess out. We're gonna put them in the <time_token_41> <time_token_43> platter for about five minutes. We don't need much because if you fry them right now, the flour <time_token_43> <time_token_45> is gonna get out of there and they're not gonna fry very well. So just wait five to ten minutes <time_token_45> <time_token_48> and then we're gonna heat the oil. For the tentacles, very easy. Just take one and the <time_token_48> <time_token_50> same thing, cover it with flour and after that, after it's well covered, just take out the excess. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> So it's been about ten minutes and now if you can tell the flour, it doesn't look like dry. It's <time_token_53> <time_token_55> becoming to get wet. So this is what we want. Now we're gonna start to heat the oil. We're gonna <time_token_55> <time_token_59> need a temperature of 180 Celsius or 360 Fahrenheit and this is a very hot temperature. So keep in <time_token_59> <time_token_61> mind that use your biggest flame so that you can get this temperature. Okay guys, so now the oil <time_token_61> <time_token_64> has got the temperature of 360 Fahrenheit. This is before the oil starts to get like smoke. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> So it's a little bit before that. So if you got the smoke like I am right now, just lower the <time_token_66> <time_token_69> temperature and take it away for maybe like 20 seconds and the temperature is gonna drop. This <time_token_69> <time_token_72> is just to show you if you don't have a thermometer. Okay guys, so now that we got the temperature, <time_token_72> <time_token_76> we're gonna start frying them. For one minute, maybe a minute and a half because if you go over <time_token_76> <time_token_79> that, they will become like rubber. Just go little by little. Don't put too much and when you see <time_token_79> <time_token_81> they're like this color, just take them out. These are ready. Just keep the heat on high so <time_token_81> <time_token_85> that you can keep the temperature and I'm gonna keep frying until I finish all of them. Every <time_token_85> <time_token_87> time you take some calamaries out, wait maybe like one minute so that the temperature goes up again. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> The heat is on high still, always on high. Just making sure the temperature is high. Now it's been <time_token_89> <time_token_92> like one minute. We're gonna start putting some more in there. Okay guys, so here in the big <time_token_92> <time_token_94> batter, we have placed some lettuce leaves, a little bit of Tabasco sauce and of course the <time_token_94> <time_token_96> calamari rings and this is the final dish. It's very good. I know you guys are gonna like it, <time_token_96> <time_token_98> so don't forget to comment, rate and subscribe. See you next time. Bye.

This is Dragon and today I'm doing a <time_token_1> <time_token_3> cooking video and guess what I'm making today? Hmm, yep you got it. It's naan or <time_token_3> <time_token_4> naan, one of my favorite flatbread. So what we would need is one teaspoon of <time_token_4> <time_token_6> yeast, one tablespoon sugar, half a cup of warm water, 3 tablespoons soy milk, 1 <time_token_6> <time_token_7> teaspoon salt, and about 2 cups of bread flour, and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> Okay, let's make the dough. So in the lukewarm water, we're gonna go ahead and <time_token_9> <time_token_10> add the yeast, oops, okay add the yeast, and then we're gonna go ahead and add <time_token_10> <time_token_11> the sugar, just a little bit to help activate the yeast. We're gonna mix it <time_token_11> <time_token_12> well and don't worry about the lumps, it should be okay. Let it sit for 10 <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Okay, in the meantime, we're gonna go ahead and shift the bread flour. I have <time_token_14> <time_token_15> divided the bread flour into two parts. The first part is a cup and a half, which <time_token_15> <time_token_17> I'm shifting right now, and the second one is a half a cup. I like to go ahead <time_token_17> <time_token_18> and divide them so it's easy to mix the wet with the dry ingredients. So go <time_token_18> <time_token_19> ahead and shift until all the lumps are gone, and then we're gonna add the rest <time_token_19> <time_token_21> of the ingredients. Here's the sugar, salt, and not that yet. The soy milk, I'm gonna <time_token_21> <time_token_23> make a little hole and put the soy milk in the middle, and the olive oil. Okay, go <time_token_23> <time_token_24> ahead and clean the workstation. We like a nice workstation. Oh, don't <time_token_24> <time_token_26> forget your yeast. Add the yeast mixture into the bowl and mix well. I like to use <time_token_26> <time_token_27> my hands, I don't mind getting dirty, but if you don't like getting your hands <time_token_27> <time_token_28> sticky, you can use a spatula or a wooden spoon, and go ahead and add the <time_token_28> <time_token_29> rest of the bread flour, and we're gonna mix it well. <time_token_29> <time_token_33> Go ahead and dump the whole thing onto your work space to start kneading, and take out <time_token_33> <time_token_35> all of the good dough and start kneading. I like to just fold it and press it down, <time_token_35> <time_token_36> fold it and press it down. There is no correct way, you can do it the way you want to, but <time_token_36> <time_token_37> this is how I do it. You're going to go ahead and knead this for about 6-8 minutes or until <time_token_37> <time_token_39> it's incorporated evenly. If you're using an electric mixer, probably about 3-4 minutes. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Go ahead and keep doing this until it's mixed. <time_token_40> <time_token_43> Ta-da! So here is my dough. Beautiful, isn't it? Okay, we're gonna go ahead and get a clean <time_token_43> <time_token_45> bowl and spray oil, or you can dab it, uh, oil onto a napkin and just wipe the bowl. <time_token_45> <time_token_47> Go ahead and spray on top as well. We're gonna cover this for one hour to rise or until it <time_token_47> <time_token_49> doubles. Let me get something to cover here. Okay. Alrighty, see you back in an hour. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> Okay, here's my dough about an hour later. I should have at least doubled in size, <time_token_51> <time_token_53> and we're gonna go ahead and sprinkle some flour onto the working surface. And this is how I divide <time_token_53> <time_token_56> my doughs. I like to go ahead and pinch and pull. Just pinch and pull. I'm making six nans, <time_token_56> <time_token_58> a medium-sized nan. If you want a bigger size, you'll probably want to make four pieces. Because <time_token_58> <time_token_59> the smaller you get, you won't be able to stretch it too much. You're gonna go ahead and cover again <time_token_59> <time_token_60> and let it rise for about 10 minutes. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> So after 10 minutes, take one of the small dough and you're gonna start rolling out the dough. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> Now, today I'm using a glass. I didn't have a rolling pin when I did this video, <time_token_64> <time_token_66> so I'm just using what I have. Don't judge, okay? So you're gonna roll it out as thinly as you want. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Just pull it out like you make a pizza. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Make sure you don't pull out too much. You don't want a hole in your bread. So something like this. <time_token_71> <time_token_73> Okay, so after 30 minutes of rising, you're gonna take a pan and preheat it on a medium-high. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> You're gonna go ahead and pat the flattened dough with water and place it on the pan. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> If you don't have a non-stick pan, make sure you grease the pan before putting the dough down. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> You're gonna cook each side about two to three minutes on each side, and then you'll notice that <time_token_78> <time_token_79> there's gonna be bubbles that come up, and then you'll know to start flipping, just as if you <time_token_79> <time_token_81> were making pancake. So if you can see, there's a bubble actually forming or starting to form <time_token_81> <time_token_83> on the dough, and it's going to be about a minute to flip it over to the other side. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> Okay, so I've went ahead and flipped on both sides, and then, so if you notice, <time_token_86> <time_token_88> there's a nicely brown charge on each side of the dough, and once you're done with that, <time_token_88> <time_token_90> you'll put it aside, and I like to brush it with melted butter. You can also use olive oil, <time_token_90> <time_token_91> or you can just leave it plain. Sometimes I like just leaving it plain. It's not necessary to <time_token_91> <time_token_93> actually brush anything on these. They're as good as they are by themselves.

How you doing Lorcan? Alright. What have you got in store for us today? This time we're going to do another traditional Irish dish, box tea. Oh lovely. <time_token_4> <time_token_7> Now, this does my head in because I last a half a dozen different relatives and they'll give me a half a dozen different recipes. <time_token_7> <time_token_10> So I've decided to go with my own version of this, alright. My mother, sorry mom, you know, you said no mashed potato in there but I have a little bit of cooked potato. <time_token_10> <time_token_13> Let me see. I've got to start off with these lovely red rooster potatoes which I'm going to peel and grate. <time_token_13> <time_token_17> This is a coarse grater, cheese grater and in that goes like so. Right, now that the potato is grated, I'm going to rinse off the starch. <time_token_17> <time_token_20> You've got to now squeeze as much of the water out as you possibly can. Do this over the sink if you want. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> That's as much water as I'm going to get out of that in that goes back in there. Now this is where my mother and I differ. <time_token_22> <time_token_24> This is cooked potato and I'm going to add this to the raw and cooked potato together. <time_token_26> <time_token_29> I'm going to add, let's see, I'm going to add about two of these, two tablespoons of flour, salt and pepper. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Doctor, turn away. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> Now, what do you serve this with, I hope? <time_token_32> <time_token_32> I've never served it. <time_token_32> <time_token_32> You've never served it before? <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Never made it before, so what should I serve it with? <time_token_33> <time_token_35> Now, a wee drop of oil I'm going to put in there. Well, we have this for breakfast years and years ago. <time_token_35> <time_token_38> My mother tells me in the days gone by they used to cook this in larder dripping and the kids would take this to school for their lunch. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Now, how true that is? <time_token_39> <time_token_40> I'm sure if your mother told you it must be true. How could you doubt your own mother? <time_token_40> <time_token_43> And the other thing is, it's great for breakfast. Fried eggs and, you know, I have some bacon in the fridge and eggs. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> You haven't had breakfast before you come here today, have you? <time_token_44> <time_token_45> No, not pretty compared to that. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Right, let's get on and let's do this. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> A bit of oil, a bit of butter, and that's ready for the boxes. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> And I think a nice bit of bacon. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> That's it, that's boxy. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> No, this is the boxy. I'm going to put that on. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> And the rules are not too thick. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> So put on it as a bowl and then I'm going to squish it down. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> Why are you adding the bacon to the boxy, Connie? <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Give it a little bit more flavour. It's going to have the bacon taste in it now, yeah? <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Be honest, if you worked in a restaurant or a hotel, you wouldn't serve eggs after such. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> But it's only me, so you don't care. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> Yeah, I don't. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Bacon, boxy and fried egg. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> I'll give you two of those. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Oh, you're so generous. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> I'll have to wait an hour for mine, but don't worry about me. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> And a very speckled-flipping fried egg. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> God, you're so bitchy, you are. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Well, do you realise the number of people that are watching these videos? <time_token_78> <time_token_78> Right, we'll make less speckled. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> I wouldn't want people thinking this was a special way of serving eggs. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> Have you seen what O'Reilly's doing on his recipe site? <time_token_82> <time_token_83> He's making speckled eggs. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> It's a novelty. There you go. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Look at that. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> Come on, let's finish off. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> Say goodbye to Tony. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> All the best.

At times, I feel lazy to prepare our Henry Wazaitam veg biryani so I tried to prepare <time_token_4> <time_token_4> an easier version of it. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> So welcome to Bookingsville, I am here with easy veggie biryani, this is very easy to <time_token_5> <time_token_6> It has got lot more vegetables than how normal hetavayatam veg biryani, so lot more nutritious, <time_token_6> <time_token_7> lot more easy to do and lot more delicious. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> So don't try and let me know how it turned out to be and I will update my blog for this <time_token_7> <time_token_8> recipe as soon as possible, I will write about what do I think about this recipe, how did <time_token_8> <time_token_9> I invented it, I mean how did I change my recipe. <time_token_9> <time_token_9> So let's see the ingredients required for the biryani. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> So here we have the ingredients required for the biryani, at first I have some rice here, <time_token_11> <time_token_12> I have soaked it for about an hour, you may also soak for 30 minutes, that's ok. <time_token_12> <time_token_12> Coriander and mint leaves both are chopped and mixed. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Now I have blanched some cauliflower as well as I have, what I have done is cooked this <time_token_14> <time_token_15> paneer in some ghee for about 30 seconds so that the sides of it gets hard as well as <time_token_15> <time_token_16> after that I have soaked it in water for about a minute. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> That will do is the sides of it will be hard and it won't get too hard. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> I mean it will be soft as well as it will be able to retain its shape while we are cooking <time_token_18> <time_token_20> I have some onion, sweet corn, caxicum, carrot, this peas, green chillies, now I have some <time_token_20> <time_token_21> nuts here, this is roasted almonds, roasted cashew nuts and some what you say raisins <time_token_21> <time_token_22> as well as some ginger garlic paste. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> I have not taken the seasons here, I am going to tell the seasons when I am preparing it <time_token_23> <time_token_23> so let's prepare it. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> So here I have a big pot in which we are going to prepare our rice, take about 5 cups of <time_token_24> <time_token_25> water and add some zera to it, cumin seeds, I am using some black cumin seeds which is <time_token_25> <time_token_26> known as sahizira in Hindi and I am going to add some salt to it, 3 teaspoons of salt <time_token_26> <time_token_27> here so that we get each and every grain of rice separate and it will look very delicious <time_token_27> <time_token_28> so add lots of salt and lots of oil to it, about 4 teaspoons to 5 teaspoons of oil here. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> The oil in which onions were fried can also be used here as a normal prepared add for <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Cardamom gloves can also be added and cinnamon stick too, I have added some gloves here. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Let's prepare our vegetables, I have a big pot here so that it's easier to prepare our <time_token_32> <time_token_33> easy veggie piryani, take about 4 teaspoons of oil here, I am taking about 4 to 5 teaspoons <time_token_33> <time_token_34> of roughly about 2 tablespoons of oil and let's temper this oil up. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Here I have some whole garam masala, not all the ingredients but some ingredients, here <time_token_35> <time_token_36> I have gloves, cinnamon stick, cardamom and zera here I have, you may also use dugger <time_token_36> <time_token_37> fool and mace and all but these 3 ingredients are perfect for me. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> I like only these ingredients in my piryani, let's wait until it is better, after that <time_token_38> <time_token_39> add the ginger garlic paste to it, 2 teaspoons of ginger garlic paste here, saute it until <time_token_39> <time_token_39> the raw flavor is gone. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> It's optional to add ginger garlic and onions, for in sattvic piryani, here I have the onions, <time_token_40> <time_token_42> just wait until the onions are a little bit translucent or pink, now wait until it's done, <time_token_42> <time_token_43> you may also add salt at this moment, we are going to add later, here is the water which <time_token_43> <time_token_43> is boiling up very nicely, make sure the water is very nicely bubbling up otherwise the rice <time_token_43> <time_token_44> may not cook very fast and not nicely, so wait until it's bubbling up nicely, use basmati <time_token_44> <time_token_46> rice for better flavor, just mix it up once so that the salt and oil gets mixed and cooks <time_token_46> <time_token_48> very nicely, so now we are going to wait until it's cooked very nicely, take about 4-5 minutes <time_token_48> <time_token_49> as we have soaked it for about 1 hour, let's head on towards our vegetables again, you <time_token_49> <time_token_50> may any time visit my blog cookandchook.blogspot.com for text recipes and detailed recipes, what <time_token_50> <time_token_51> do I think about blog and what do I think about food and all, so head on towards cookandchook.blogspot.com <time_token_51> <time_token_52> if you are watching from youtube, I have added the carrots here because these were raw and <time_token_52> <time_token_53> other vegetables with somewhat cooked and blanched, so I added the carrots first, after <time_token_53> <time_token_54> that I have added some salt here, so just give it a mix and wait until the carrot is <time_token_54> <time_token_55> somewhat cooked which will take about a minute or so, after that we are going to add some <time_token_55> <time_token_56> more vegetables to it and prepare it, so now it looks done, I have added some capsicum <time_token_56> <time_token_57> and I am going to toss it for 10 seconds, after that I am going to add the vegetables, <time_token_57> <time_token_58> cauliflower here, corn and the peas, so these 3 ingredients, any vegetable that you like <time_token_58> <time_token_59> can be added, even French beans can be added and all, so let's test our rice, it has been <time_token_59> <time_token_60> about 5 minutes, take some rice grains, 2 methods are there, one is between pressing <time_token_60> <time_token_61> with the finger, if it's done, it will press very nicely, other method, taste it, the best <time_token_61> <time_token_62> method it's done, for me, let's spread it in the plate after straining it, so make sure <time_token_62> <time_token_63> you spread it in the plate so that it goes faster and it's easier to work with, now let's <time_token_63> <time_token_65> prepare our complete vegetables, I have the paneer here, paneer is also optional, what <time_token_65> <time_token_66> I said before is I have tossed the paneer once in the key, after that I have added to <time_token_66> <time_token_66> the water which will do is, the paneer edges will be hard and it will be easier to cook, <time_token_66> <time_token_67> I have also added the green chillies and the mint and curd and don't add too much mint <time_token_67> <time_token_68> and curd and in this, just little bit for that flavour, we don't want anything too much <time_token_68> <time_token_69> here, I am going to add the garam, I mean the biryani masala here, 2 teaspoons of biryani <time_token_69> <time_token_70> masala and about half a teaspoon of black pepper to this, biryani masala is optional <time_token_70> <time_token_71> that if you don't add the biryani masala, then also it tastes awesome, just it will <time_token_71> <time_token_72> taste little bit like fried rice, so now it looks little bit blackish but it will be very <time_token_72> <time_token_73> very delicious, trust me, I am going to add some garam masala here and the sugar, little <time_token_73> <time_token_74> bit of sugar, just a pinch, you don't add too much sugar, that will make the rice sweet <time_token_74> <time_token_75> and it will not taste too much and too nice, so just a pinch of sugar between parents out <time_token_75> <time_token_76> everything here, give a mix and add the rice here, before adding the rice, I am going to <time_token_76> <time_token_77> finish it off with some nuts, make sure to add the nuts at the last moment because if <time_token_77> <time_token_78> you add before, it may not be crunchy and it will be soggy, add the rice carefully, <time_token_78> <time_token_79> be gentle with the rice as we have cooked this rice completely, it will break very easily, <time_token_79> <time_token_80> be gentle with it, it's not a hadam biryani in which we can handle the rice, not so easy, <time_token_80> <time_token_82> be gentle, give it a mix and then we are going to give it a thumb of about 5 minutes <time_token_82> <time_token_83> in the kadai itself, so it's a kind of pull out but it's on the side of biryani but we have not <time_token_83> <time_token_84> added the yogurt or kadai, if you want to add about 2 to 3 tablespoons of yogurt to it, <time_token_84> <time_token_85> totally optional and the saffron here, saffron is also optional, just for the flavor sake, <time_token_85> <time_token_86> I am adding the saffron here, so now I am going to finish it off with some water, <time_token_86> <time_token_87> water will help in preventing from sticking to the bottom and very nicely cover it up and wait <time_token_87> <time_token_88> until it is cooked for about 5 minutes, so now the biryani is looking awesome and the smell is <time_token_88> <time_token_89> just mesmerizing, I am just going to cover over it, I taste it also, it tastes awesome, <time_token_89> <time_token_91> just add the nuts, I am finished off with some nuts here, so if you want to add less nuts, <time_token_91> <time_token_92> go ahead add some less nuts, I have some mirchika salan and some raita here, I have served with them, <time_token_92> <time_token_93> the biryani is looking just awesome, you can see the nuts and the coriander and what <time_token_93> <time_token_95> you say fried onions here, it is just looking awesome and it tastes also outstanding, <time_token_95> <time_token_96> easy to prepare, healthy to eat, nutritious also, so prepare it, do let me know how you <time_token_96> <time_token_96> turned out to be, thank you for watching, do subscribe for more

One of my favorite things to make during fall and winter is pasta fajole, <time_token_1> <time_token_2> and I have a great, easy recipe, and I'm going to show you how to do it. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> So what I have here is a big pan that I went ahead and put on about medium, medium, high heat. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> I'm going to put a tablespoon of butter in here and a little bit of olive oil. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> So this is a great, hearty soup for any time, really. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> So now what I have here is three ounces of pancetta that I went ahead and had my deli slice really thick. <time_token_8> <time_token_10> So this is just going to add a nice porkiness to the soup. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> And who doesn't love pork? <time_token_10> <time_token_11> So what I'm going to do here is cut it into cubes, just like this. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> I'm going to add it in here. This is going to add a lot of flavor. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> All right. So now I'm going to go ahead and chop this all up. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> We're going to go ahead and put it in here. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> I'm going to cook it. I'm going to give it a delicious flavor. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> So like that. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> So you can instantly smell how delicious this is. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> So now I'm going to do some chopping. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> We have three stalks of celery, three carrots, one onion, one clove of garlic. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> We're just going to go ahead and chop up. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> I'll show you how I like to chop this celery. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> I like to take off the ends. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Just to make it easier and more uniform, cut it in half. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> And just chop it just like this. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> All right. So now I'm going to show you how to cut the carrots. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> I like to cut off the top, cut off the bottom a little bit to the side. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Now you can see how the carrot gets a lot thinner towards the bottom. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> So I cut it right there. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> I'm just going to cut it. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> Go ahead and cut this one just in half. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> Just chop this one up. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> And then for the thicker part, I'm going to chop it in half <time_token_29> <time_token_30> and then chop that half in half. <time_token_30> <time_token_30> So they're all uniform sizes. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Just like that. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> All right. So let's go ahead and add this all to our delicious pancake oil. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> And stir this around while it's cooked. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> And I'm going to show you how to do the onions as well. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> So we're going to go finish the carrot just like this. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> All right. So now for the onion, what I like to do is I just chop off the top, <time_token_41> <time_token_42> chop off the bottom, cut it in half. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> So now I'm going to chop it just like this, not all the way to the end. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Then you're going to slice it kind of in half just like that. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> And when you cut it, it comes out in uniform pieces just like that. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> I'm going to add this in there as well. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> It's a good stir so everything starts cooking down. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Sounds amazing already. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> Everything smells better with a little pig in it. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> That's what I think. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> I'm going to chop the other one. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> And then we're going to add the garlic. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> And then we're going to add some stock, some beans. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> All right. So we went ahead and just let this cook until the onions are translucent <time_token_58> <time_token_58> in just about a minute or two. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> So now we're going to go ahead and add one can of diced tomatoes in here. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Now I'm going to use cannellini beans, which are basically white kidney beans. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> You can use red if you want or one can of one, one can of the other, whatever you like. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> I like the white ones. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> I'm going to add those in there. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> I'm going to add one bay leaf. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> I'm going to add a couple sprigs of fresh thyme. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> You don't even have to. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> I'm going to add some thyme in here. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> I'm going to add some fresh rosemary. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> You don't have to worry about taking them off because they'll fall off <time_token_68> <time_token_68> and it's going to be delicious in there. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> We're going to add 48 ounces of chicken broth right in here. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> And then we're going to let this come up to a simmer. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> We're going to let it cook for about an hour. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> All right. So this is beautiful. It's delicious. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> We've been letting it simmer for about 30 minutes. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> Now over here in another pot we have about a cup and a half <time_token_75> <time_token_76> of these little ditalini pasta. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> This is cut macaroni. You can use regular macaroni. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> You can use whatever you want really. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> But I like to use this because it's kind of hearty and small at the same time. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> So what we're going to do is just drain it. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> Now the reason we're not cooking it in this liquid is if you do that, <time_token_79> <time_token_80> when pasta cooks it absorbs a lot of the liquid. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> It is going to absorb a lot of this liquid and that's exactly what we don't want. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> So then we just cook this al dente over here. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> I'm going to finish up in here and still get the delicious flavor. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> So we're going to go ahead and just put our pasta in just like this. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> This is going to be very easy, very delicious. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> It makes the whole house smell good. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> Anyone is going to like this. All right. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> So now that we have all of our pasta in, <time_token_87> <time_token_88> we can go ahead and fish out all of our stems and our bay leaf. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> As you can see, they come out just like this. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> See? You don't even have to worry about taking out the stem. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> We have our thyme land right there. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Let's go ahead and stir it all together. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> We have our rosemary spoon. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> Perfect. Look at this. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> A nice, hearty, delicious soup. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> You can see all the beans, all the vegetables and the pancetta. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Gives it a nice kind of smoky flavor. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> A little twist on the regular pasta fissure. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> There you go. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> I like to serve it in a bowl with some parmesan cheese on the sauce. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> There you go. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> The pasta fissure, I hope you like it.

Heat up the oil. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> I'm putting about, since we're making three cans of chickpeas, I'm going to put about three tablespoons, maybe slightly more than three tablespoons of oil. <time_token_3> <time_token_3> How much heat? <time_token_3> <time_token_4> The heat's on medium to high right now. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> The pan's already kind of hot, so we're going to go with that giant onion. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> One thing I remember reading once was about how different cultures cook garlic differently. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> And so in Italy, they like to make sure that the garlic is just touched by the heat. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> They don't like to burn it. Whereas in Indian cooking a lot, you'll see browned garlic. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> Maybe I can put the ginger and the green chilli right now. So why don't we do that? <time_token_10> <time_token_10> There's a nice beer, by the way. What is this? Full-scent handle? <time_token_10> <time_token_11> You sound like you're doing a little spot for them. This is nice beer. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> All of them? This is nice beer, damn it. <time_token_12> <time_token_12> That's how they do it. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> Have you reached that point? Like, can I not say this is nice beer without suddenly being seen as a commercial chill? <time_token_13> <time_token_14> So we've got so far the onion, the chilies, the ginger. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> We're going to put in the two giant cloves of garlic that we chopped. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> And we could even put more depending on how much you love garlic. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> I actually love garlic, but I'm not going to make this too crazy. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> I think at this point, we're basically ready for the spices. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> You can take a quick look at the onion, and you'll see that it is getting... <time_token_19> <time_token_19> ...thinkish, light brownish, I might say. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> I would venture to say... <time_token_20> <time_token_20> I might be so bold as to say... <time_token_20> <time_token_21> One could be so bold as to say that this is light brown. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> So now we're ready for the master spice, the chana masala. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> This is key. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> And of course, the way I'm going to do it is I'm going to not measure anything. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> But I recommend you don't do this at home. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> The right way to do this really is you measure, and I would say, a tablespoon of this powder for each can of chickpeas. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> It's probably good. So that was one tablespoon. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> I'm going to go sprinkle another tablespoon right there. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> And I'd say three tablespoons, and I'm going to put one more for good luck. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> That's a bit... <time_token_28> <time_token_28> I know it seems like a lot, but there's a lot of chickpeas. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> There's a lot of chickpeas. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> All right, I think this is ready to go with the tomatoes. <time_token_30> <time_token_30> So at this point, you can see this is all the brown spices sort of mixed in there. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> The onions have reduced quite a bit. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> And now we put in the tomatoes. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Here we go. <time_token_32> <time_token_32> And honestly, with tomatoes, the more the better. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> You really can't go wrong. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> So quick recap, onions. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> You try to get them a little pink. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Then you put in ginger and chili peppers. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Then you put in a little bit of garlic. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> And when everything's sort of getting pink, <time_token_37> <time_token_37> you put in the chana masala powder. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> And when that's cooked a little bit, <time_token_38> <time_token_39> you've got to cook the masalas a little bit, the spices. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> And when that's done, you put in the tomatoes, <time_token_39> <time_token_40> and you've got yourself... <time_token_40> <time_token_40> Basically, you're essentially done at this point. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> You're just going to let the tomato and everything stew a little bit. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> And at the end of that, you're going to put in the chickpeas, <time_token_41> <time_token_42> and then you're going to just let it cook for as long as possible. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> Actually, it's something I just want to mention here. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Right here, this is the basis of a lot of Indian dishes. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> If you want to use this as a base, <time_token_44> <time_token_44> you can make a lot of vegetables going forward from here. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> Alright, so we've got the first can of chickpeas in. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> I'm really hungry. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> The beauty is once you've added the peas, <time_token_47> <time_token_47> it's going to take very little time. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> So we're going to put in a little bit of water <time_token_48> <time_token_48> because it needs a little bit of water, basically. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Just by looking at it, it looks a little mushy. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> We need a little bit more watery gravy. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> So I'm putting about, I would say, half a cup. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> And now the salt. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> What are you talking about? We don't do set-ups. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> It's not a show. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> We're just cooking. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> We talk constantly about what we're doing while we're cooking. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Actually, I think part of the charm of what we're doing right here <time_token_54> <time_token_54> is watching Sush and Nishala trying to make a cooking show. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> You've got to admit, that's part of what's funny about this. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> Maybe that's what we should call it. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Something like Sush and Nishala try to make a cooking show. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> That is what we're trying to do. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> I had a friend, by the way. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> I don't have him anymore. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> His name was Shrikant. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> And he contributed two things to my life that I will never forget. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> He was a South Indian kid. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> The first thing was, he would always say, to be Frankly. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Which I loved. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> I have never forgotten that. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> And then the other thing that he did was, we were playing cricket. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> And he got out and then like, in the next game, <time_token_62> <time_token_63> I mean, we played many games with crickets every evening. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> He came back and he got in with his bat and he said, <time_token_64> <time_token_64> I am back with a vaginence. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> I hope we got that one. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> So, just to prove that we're legit cooks. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Alright, we've got here, all the way from India. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> A champion of Indian cooking. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> My mom, who happens to be visiting me here in LA. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> And so, what better taster for the food than her? <time_token_68> <time_token_68> So here she comes. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> She has brought her own spoon. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> She's going to sample and tell us if it's any good. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> And I have more than two here. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Say it to the camera, please. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> That was not convincing. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Try it again. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Take it again. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Show some emotion. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> So, the chickpeas aren't actually soft. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Sometimes in some of these cans, they end up being really hard. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> So what we're going to do is, we're going to add a little bit of water. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Just a little. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> I would say like half a cup. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> We're going to mix it around. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I'm going to mix it around like this. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> And we're going to cover it. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> We're going to cover it and turn it to somewhere between low and medium. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> And leave it there for about, I would say, another ten minutes. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> We are going to garnish the chana masala for aesthetic purposes. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Which consists of just picking up these chopped red onions. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Dude, you don't have to explain it. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> And some coriander. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> You don't have to make this any worse than it is. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Sprinkling it on top, which really does look very nice, I would say. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> And then you can just squeeze a little bit of water. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> I think we are all ready to eat. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> And there you go. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> You can get good naan at Whole Foods. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> Right now we've got some Trader Joe's naan, which we're going to pop into the oven. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> It's this tandoori garlic naan. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> It's not really naan per se, but it works. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> So we're going to toss it in there. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> The oven is like 350 or whatever. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> It's a dirty oven right now. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> And just leave it in there for like, I don't know, three to four minutes. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> Check on it. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> And then you'll be ready to go. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> Alright, so here we go. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> This is how you do it. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> It's nice and hot. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> And so what you do is you just grab a bite. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> You grab some chana masala, and you stick it in your cake hole. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> How is that? <time_token_96> <time_token_96> This is delicious. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> It's absolutely fantastic. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> You should probably shoot that again without using the word cake hole, I think. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> I think cake hole is great. <time_token_98> <time_token_98> You could also do naan hole.

If you haven't already, please subscribe to <time_token_2> <time_token_4> our channel. Okay, some falafel on the menu today. These are absolutely wonderful. I'm <time_token_4> <time_token_5> really pleased with how these have come out. They're really nice and light and fluffy. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> Absolutely delicious. Let's go and do it. Okay, so let's get started on this version <time_token_7> <time_token_8> of falafel. Like I said, there were many, many different ways of making it. Lots of people put <time_token_8> <time_token_9> different bits and pieces in. This is our version. I've got some garlic there. For the amount of, <time_token_9> <time_token_11> I'm going to use about 400 grams, 500 grams of cooked chickpeas. So I've got about two or three <time_token_11> <time_token_13> cloves in there, but adjust it how you want. I'm putting in some red onion. Some people use white, <time_token_13> <time_token_14> I'm using a red. And then here I've got a whole load of, this is a mix actually, this is coriander <time_token_14> <time_token_16> and parsley. You can put one in or you can do what I've done and put both in. I'm then going to add <time_token_16> <time_token_17> just a little splash of olive oil to help it's on its way. We're going to blend this together. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> Then I'll be back. Okay, so as you can see, that's been mixed nicely. I'm now going to go in with my <time_token_20> <time_token_22> chickpeas, which are nicely cooked. I'm going to add some salt, <time_token_23> <time_token_23> some black pepper, <time_token_24> <time_token_26> cumin powder. For this amount, I've got like two teaspoons and two teaspoons of coriander powder. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> And then I'm going to add some chili. You could add fresh chili if you want. I'm adding a chili <time_token_27> <time_token_29> powder, red chili powder. And they're going to be fairly hot, these ones, that's about a teaspoon. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> And then again, optional, throwing in some sesame seeds. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> Now I need to add just a little bit of baking powder. That'll just sort of help them on their <time_token_33> <time_token_35> way when they're cooking. Some people put flour in now. I'm not using flour today. Some people <time_token_35> <time_token_37> use baking soda entirely up to you. I'm going to add a little more splash of oil. Again, a lot <time_token_37> <time_token_38> of people don't put any oil in. They might just add a little water. We don't want this to be too <time_token_38> <time_token_38> wet. I mean, we're not making hummus here because remember, we've got to make these into shapes and <time_token_38> <time_token_41> then fry them off. Once again, whizz it up. See you in a moment. So you can see now I've got this <time_token_42> <time_token_43> kind of consistency. A little bit wet. We certainly don't want it any wetter than this, <time_token_43> <time_token_45> but it's dry enough to us to mold into the shapes we want. So that, I'm really happy with that. Now, <time_token_45> <time_token_46> of course, look, if you want more chili, add more chili. If you want more cumin, add more. Just get <time_token_46> <time_token_48> it how you want it. There's no real big rule here. Cumin coriander are pretty important in this, <time_token_48> <time_token_50> parsley pretty important, but just play around. Get it just how you want it. There's no rule, <time_token_50> <time_token_51> but let's go and get these into some shapes and then we'll start cooking them. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Okay, so as you can see what I've done here, I've just molded these into some different shapes. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> These are the kind of small balls, nice for snacks. These are more your pate for your burger. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> They go nice inside, you know, your pita bread or your covers with your salad if you're going to <time_token_55> <time_token_56> eat them like that. And that's just a variant little sausage type thing. Mold them out exactly <time_token_56> <time_token_57> how you want. The next thing to do is get some nice hot oil. I'm going to deep fry mine, <time_token_57> <time_token_58> slightly unhealthy, but that's how it's done traditionally. You can bake these now if you <time_token_58> <time_token_59> want. You can put that straight in the oven. It's on a metal dish and they will cook, <time_token_59> <time_token_60> or you can sort of just shallow fry them. I'm going for the deep fried, <time_token_60> <time_token_62> sorry about that. Let's go and do that. Okay, so I've put my oil here. I'm using a sunflower oil. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> You can use any oil you like. And as you can see, I've just dropped a little bit in just to see if <time_token_63> <time_token_65> the oil is right. I think it is. Now the tricky part because these are fairly delicate. We're <time_token_65> <time_token_67> going to drop them in. Now you don't want your oil to be raging, raging hot <time_token_67> <time_token_69> because they'll just really burn really quickly. So I've got a medium, medium bubble there, <time_token_69> <time_token_70> as you can see. And then they go. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> And these are just going to take about two or three minutes. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> There's no need to touch them at this stage. Let them just do their thing. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> Let's get this other one in there. Just make sure they're not touching each other now because <time_token_74> <time_token_76> they might stick a little bit. A little shake. And yeah, I'll be back in a couple of minutes. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Okay, these look about ready. I'm going to fish them out. <time_token_78> <time_token_80> And I'm putting them on some kitchen towel. Yeah, beautiful color. I don't want to cook them more <time_token_80> <time_token_83> than that. Yeah, I'm quite happy with these. So let me just cook those other two. I've got <time_token_83> <time_token_84> two larger ones that I showed you earlier, kind of burger looking ones. <time_token_85> <time_token_87> And then these. Yeah, lovely, lovely color. These are going to be ready to eat. See you in a moment. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> Okay, so there we go. As you can see, they're lovely and crispy. I've got one here that's <time_token_89> <time_token_91> broken open, nice and moist and beautiful inside. It tastes perfect to me. I'm serving <time_token_91> <time_token_92> this with some bread and some tahina or tahini, which is a sesame seed paste. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Hope you enjoy these. They're really easy to make. Like I said, you can bake them, <time_token_93> <time_token_94> you can shallow fry them or do what I've done and deep fry them. See you again soon. Bye-bye. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> I forgot to mention that I just made this small amount, but the amount that we made in the mixer <time_token_96> <time_token_97> is enough to make.

<time_token_54> <time_token_55> Well, you've heard the expression being able to read body language. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> Here you have to be able to read bubble language. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> The bubbles will tell you. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> First you're going to see bubbles around the outside. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Then you're going to see bubbles come up through the middle. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> When the bubbles come up through the middle, turn your pancake. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> And it works every time. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> So depending on your flame, depending on your pan, medium to medium high heat should <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Once you flip them, the other side goes a little quicker. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> So if the first side took two, three minutes, maybe the second side takes a minute to two <time_token_69> <time_token_69> But you'll know. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> You know when pancakes are cooked. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> We're all born with that ability. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> It's in our DNA. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> All right, I'm going to transfer those to a warm plate. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> Nothing says, I don't really love you that much, like serving food on ice cold plates. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> So don't do that. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> It's for breakfast. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> I'm going to spread a little bit of butter on top. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> You know, optional, but by optional, I mean, please do it. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> It's not pancakes unless you get a little melted butter on there. <time_token_79> <time_token_81> And then cue gratuitous maple syrup scene. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Sorry, I can't find my sexy music sound clip. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> But anyway, you can hum that part to yourself. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> And there we go. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Good old fashioned pancakes. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> How amazingly simple. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> This is the classic recipe. <time_token_86> <time_token_89> Not too thick, not too thin, tender, delicious, just amazing. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> So I really hope you give these a try. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> This was a very popular food wish. <time_token_91> <time_token_93> All the ingredients are on foodwishes.com, as usual. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> And as always, enjoy.

<time_token_3> <time_token_4> I'm going to teach you how to cook the best scrambled eggs. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> So first if you want to come down here and see what I've got in front of me, I've got <time_token_6> <time_token_7> three free range eggs. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> I've also got just maybe I'm going to use about a tablespoon of butter, a little bit <time_token_8> <time_token_11> of sea salt flakes there and in the jug here I've got about a third of a cup of cream. <time_token_11> <time_token_13> So in order to make the world's best scrambled eggs, you need to break your three eggs into <time_token_13> <time_token_13> a little bowl. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> So once they're in the bowl, avoiding the eggshell of course, we're going to add our <time_token_18> <time_token_19> third of a cup of cream to that little bowl. <time_token_19> <time_token_22> Over here we're going to put the pan on. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> I'm using a non-stick pan which is really, really important. <time_token_23> <time_token_26> I'm using the induction cooktop and I'm turning on the pan to induction setting eight which <time_token_26> <time_token_28> is about medium to hot on your gas or your electric cooktop and we're going to take <time_token_28> <time_token_30> a fork as our pan is heating up and just mix the cream and the egg together there. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> What I'm trying to achieve is just that yolk is mixed through so I don't want any streaks <time_token_32> <time_token_35> of yolk in our egg mixture and as our pan is heating up, I'm just going to take just <time_token_35> <time_token_37> the smallest knob of butter there, put it into the pan and that's going to begin to <time_token_37> <time_token_39> I'm also going to take a little bit of our sea salt flakes, they're going to go into <time_token_39> <time_token_40> the base of the pan which is going to help those sea salt flakes to start to dissolve <time_token_40> <time_token_41> there, the heat from the pan. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> Back to our egg mixture, it's looking pretty good, the yolks are mixed through nicely. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> Want our butter to start sizzling. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> Once we've got this little sizzling action happening here now in our pan, we're almost <time_token_48> <time_token_50> ready to put our egg yolk mixture in. <time_token_51> <time_token_55> In order to help me make this best scrambled egg recipe successful, I'm also using a flat <time_token_55> <time_token_56> ended wooden spoon, as I talked about this as a non-stick pan as well which is really <time_token_56> <time_token_58> really important because we don't want the egg to stick to the base of the pan. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> So now I've got that sizzle happening, there's no colour in my butter which is also really <time_token_60> <time_token_61> I'm going to drop my eggs into the base of the pan. <time_token_61> <time_token_64> Now what you need to do is you need to resist the urge to scramble your eggs because what <time_token_64> <time_token_66> you want to start happening is that egg yolk is going to begin to set. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> The protein is going to begin to set on the base of that pan. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> So about 20 seconds, once you put that egg mixture into the base of the pan, you want <time_token_69> <time_token_70> to wait about 20 seconds before you're even going to start to attempt to scramble. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> As I'm shaking the pan, as you can see what's happening, I've got these little bubbles beginning <time_token_72> <time_token_74> to form down there so I know that protein is setting really really well. <time_token_74> <time_token_77> So once I've got my bubbles, bubbles, bubbles, my bubbles starting to form, I want to take <time_token_77> <time_token_80> my flat end of wooden spoon and begin to very very gently nudge these eggs around the pan. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> As I'm nudging the cooked stuff, the raw stuff is then taking its place. <time_token_82> <time_token_85> Just enough time for me to grab a little bit of parmesan cheese and grate that in because <time_token_85> <time_token_86> that's going to help with the flavour. <time_token_87> <time_token_90> Back to my wooden spoon, give it a bit of a nudge so the cooked stuff makes way for the <time_token_90> <time_token_92> raw stuff so what you are getting is the most gentle and delicious lightly cooked scrambled <time_token_92> <time_token_93> eggs and that pretty much is it. <time_token_93> <time_token_95> Once you're at that stage, you turn it off and the heat that's left in the scrambled <time_token_95> <time_token_97> eggs will continue to cook us through and you will guarantee have one of the best scrambled <time_token_97> <time_token_97> egg recipes

So we just came back from Firefly and we're back at Rosso and we're going to go ahead <time_token_6> <time_token_7> and make a traditional Italian pasta recipe called penne alla vodka and since we were <time_token_7> <time_token_8> just at Firefly, I figured we'd use Firefly vodka from our good friends. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> This is a really simple recipe with very few ingredients. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> We've got plum tomatoes, I use a little bit of tomato paste to kind of pump up the tomato <time_token_10> <time_token_12> flavor, garlic, salt, pepper, vodka of course, cream, butter and penne pasta. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> So the first thing we're going to do since I'm using whole San Marzano tomatoes is we're <time_token_13> <time_token_14> going to puree them a little bit so we have our sauce. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Now you can use tomato puree if you want straight from the store, that works just fine. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> This is what I have at the restaurant and I like to use these, I think they're pretty <time_token_16> <time_token_17> So we're going to just slowly blend this a little bit. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> Now if you do this also at home, I want to make sure of one thing, do not over blend <time_token_19> <time_token_20> it because what it will do is it will pump air into it and turn it into this pink mess. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> It will taste the same but it won't taste the same. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> You kind of lose the intensity of the tomatoes once it kind of aerates it. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to add a little about a tablespoon or so of tomato <time_token_23> <time_token_24> That kind of adds that concentrated flavor because what we're going to end up doing is <time_token_24> <time_token_25> watering down the tomato flavor a little bit with the vodka and the cream. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> I like my vodka sauce with a lot of garlic in it also but I don't like bits of garlic. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> This is kind of a bit of an elegant sauce so all I do is I basically take about eight <time_token_28> <time_token_29> to ten cloves of garlic, give them a good whack, breaks them open. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Put them in the pan and we're going to go over, set them on the range and get them saut\u00e9ing <time_token_30> <time_token_31> a little bit. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> All right, so we've got our garlic in the pan, we're going to use some extra virgin <time_token_32> <time_token_33> olive oil and you can use extra virgin olive oil. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> I don't care what people have told you about not being able to cook with it, it works just <time_token_34> <time_token_34> fine for cooking. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> But we're going to go ahead and we're going to let this garlic brown a little bit and <time_token_36> <time_token_36> release all of its flavor. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> All right, garlic is browning really nicely. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> Now we're going to add the tomato. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> Now be very careful when you do this. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> You want to get your tomatoes close to it because it will spatter up. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> All right, so all this brown garlic is going to infuse this tomato puree with its flavor <time_token_41> <time_token_42> but it's still just tomato puree so make sure you season. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> We're going to season with salt. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> I always use kosher salt because it's got a good feel to it, it's flaky, you can pinch <time_token_44> <time_token_45> a lot of it and control how much you're putting in. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> All right, now we're going to add some black pepper. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> We're going to put in some red pepper flakes. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Now I like my vodka sauce a little bit on the spicy side so we're going to add a little <time_token_48> <time_token_48> extra since it's mine. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> We've got our penne pasta cooking over here and some nice salty water. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> Always remember that your water should be as salty as the Mediterranean. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> All right, now we're going to add the vodka. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> We're going to let this simmer and let all those flavors from the garlic, salt and pepper <time_token_55> <time_token_56> get in there. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> If you tasted it now, it would kind of have a vodka, definitely a Bloody Mary vodka kick <time_token_59> <time_token_60> But we're going to let all the vodka simmer out of this, all the alcohol. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Now it's reduced quite a bit, it's getting thicker so we're going to go ahead and put <time_token_61> <time_token_61> in our cream. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> All right, now we'll mix it in. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Right now I probably have about two and a half cups or so of sauce and I just put in <time_token_64> <time_token_65> about three quarters of a cup of heavy cream. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Our pasta is almost done. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> As I told you earlier, we don't want to keep the garlic chunks in there so what I'm going <time_token_67> <time_token_68> to do is using my slotted spoon, I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to remove my garlic. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Now we may miss a piece or two but that's not a big deal. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> It is garlic after all and we love garlic. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> Our pasta, done, we're going to go ahead and add that to the sauce. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> We're going to go ahead and we're going to allow this pasta to cook in the sauce for <time_token_76> <time_token_77> a little while so it absorbs some of the sauce. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Now I took the pasta out when it was al dente so it's still got some bite to it, probably <time_token_78> <time_token_78> a little more bite than you would normally serve right off the bat but it's going to <time_token_78> <time_token_79> cook a little bit longer. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> All right, now we're going to put some cheese in there because it wouldn't be pasta without <time_token_80> <time_token_81> We've got some pecorino romano, you could use parmigiano reggiano, we'll keep a little <time_token_81> <time_token_81> bit on the side for when we put it on the table. <time_token_81> <time_token_83> So we're going to go ahead and mix that in, that'll thicken the sauce a little bit more, <time_token_83> <time_token_84> adds that depth of flavor that you can only get with a hard dry aged cheese. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> I think we're ready to go here. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> To richen it up a little bit we're going to go ahead and mix in a little bit of unsalted <time_token_87> <time_token_88> All right here we go. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> Penny ala vodka, now we can just put all of it in here. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> Using firefly vodka from Wodmila Island, we'll finish it with a little bit more cheese, a <time_token_91> <time_token_94> little pecorino romano and a little bit of fresh parsley gremolata and there you go. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Penny ala vodka straight to the table. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> Thanks for watching Off Menu. <time_token_96> <time_token_98> We'll see you next time.

<time_token_2> Hi everyone, welcome to another episode of Cravings Blog, I'm Karen Amed and today we're <time_token_2> <time_token_3> making something that's delicious and healthy, the Vietnamese Spring Roll. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> I was introduced to this spring roll a couple of years ago by one of my co-workers that <time_token_4> <time_token_5> brought this in for potluck. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> His parents used to own a Vietnamese restaurant and I was so taken back by the beauty of these <time_token_6> <time_token_7> spring rolls but also by the taste that I started to make these at home with many different <time_token_7> <time_token_7> fillings and my kids just love it. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> Now the plus point is it's not only healthy but it's also gluten free which today is a <time_token_9> <time_token_9> big plus to have. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> My sister-in-law is gluten intolerant and I'm always looking for recipes that I can <time_token_10> <time_token_10> serve when she visits me in the summer. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> So let's get started, I just want to go through the ingredients really quickly. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> I'm going to make a very quick dipping sauce and this dipping sauce is also going to be <time_token_12> <time_token_13> used, I'm going to use a little bit inside the spring roll just to give it a little burst <time_token_13> <time_token_14> So I've got about 2 teaspoons of hoisin sauce and I've got another 2 teaspoons of chili <time_token_14> <time_token_15> and garlic sauce and all I'm going to do is just mix these two together. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Now you can also use peanut butter, peanut butter goes really well with hoisin sauce <time_token_16> <time_token_17> but since I'm sending this to my kids school for lunch, I'm going to leave out the peanut <time_token_17> <time_token_18> I've got about a pound of regular tiger shrimp, you can also use white shrimp, I prefer my <time_token_18> <time_token_19> shrimp to be a little bit bigger but I just got a medium size today and all I do is put <time_token_19> <time_token_21> it in a pan with about a tablespoon or two of water and just let it cook, it doesn't <time_token_21> <time_token_21> take a long time with a little bit of salt. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Once that's done, I take the shrimp out and I leave it to cool but don't throw the stock <time_token_22> <time_token_23> away because it has so much flavor, even those 2 tablespoons of water has a lot of flavor <time_token_23> <time_token_24> I add some more water to that pot and then I cook my rice vermicelli, I've got about <time_token_24> <time_token_25> a cup or so of rice vermicelli and that just adds some additional flavor to the vermicelli. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Next I'm going to add arugula, you can add regular lettuce but I find that arugula has <time_token_26> <time_token_26> a beautiful peppery taste. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> I'm going to add some mint for freshness, I'm going to add a little bit of coriander, <time_token_27> <time_token_28> I've got some chunks of cucumber, I've just cut them in logs, I've got some red pepper <time_token_28> <time_token_30> that I've cut into sort of large confetti pieces, I've got julienne of carrots and I'm <time_token_30> <time_token_30> going to add some crab meat. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Now traditional Vietnamese spring rolls uses pork belly or ham, I'm going to opt to make <time_token_31> <time_token_33> this completely seafood only and so I think the shrimp and the crab together is a fantastic <time_token_33> <time_token_33> combination, my kids love it. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Now lastly we're going to use the rice paper, I've got 2 sizes here, I've got a small size <time_token_34> <time_token_35> and a medium size, today I'm going to use a medium size which is perfect for school <time_token_35> <time_token_37> lunch or snack but the small size is lovely to make little appetizers so you can choose <time_token_37> <time_token_37> to use whatever you want. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> I'm not going to talk too much about the quantity of ingredients today because I'm not too fussed <time_token_38> <time_token_39> about it, you can use as little or as much as you like. <time_token_39> <time_token_41> So I'm simply going to just mix the 2 tablespoons of chili garlic sauce together with the hoisin. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> You can leave this as is or you can add some freshly chopped coriander to it, it's totally <time_token_43> <time_token_44> up to you, just going to keep that aside and next I'm going to work on the shrimp. <time_token_44> <time_token_46> So here's what you do, take the shrimp, put it down on your board, take a really sharp <time_token_46> <time_token_46> knife and just cut it all the way through. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> I'm going to do this to every one of the shrimp and you're going to get 2 halves like <time_token_47> <time_token_48> this which are going to look really pretty in the spring roll. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> I've cut all the shrimp and put it aside and now we're going to start by softening the <time_token_51> <time_token_53> Here's my rice paper, it's quite hard, what you need is some kind of container that's <time_token_53> <time_token_53> big enough to hold some warm water. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Now don't make the mistake of taking a really small container and trying to shove this thing <time_token_54> <time_token_55> in there, I've seen some people do that, it's just not a good idea. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> So put it in and let it soak. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> It only takes literally maybe 30 seconds or so to soften up and once that's done, I'm <time_token_57> <time_token_57> going to stuff it. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> After it's nice and soft, I'm going to take it out, put it on my clean wooden board which <time_token_60> <time_token_60> I just washed. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Now we're going to stuff it. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> The first thing that's going to go down are the shrimp because I want people to be able <time_token_62> <time_token_63> to see it when they pick it up, eat with your eyes. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> So here's the shrimp, you're going to use as many as you need to depending on the size <time_token_64> <time_token_64> of your shrimp. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> If my shrimp are big, I'll use three but these ones are a little bit smaller than I plan <time_token_65> <time_token_66> to use so I'm going to use four of them. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> I'm going to put in some arugula, you can use regular lettuce but I love arugula. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> I'm going to add a mint leaf, a stick of cucumber, this is going to add a nice freshness, a little <time_token_69> <time_token_69> bit of coriander. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> I'm going to put in a tiny dab of the sauce, not too much, just a little bit. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> Some carrots, I've got some red pepper confetti but this is quite a large confetti, now this <time_token_74> <time_token_74> adds a lovely color to the bowls. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> I'm going to add a little bit of crab. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> And finally, some rice noodles, just on the top. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Now is the fun part, we're going to roll it, I'm going to try and roll it without breaking <time_token_79> <time_token_81> Obviously this takes some practice but I'm going to fold it in just like I fold in a <time_token_82> <time_token_82> Look how gorgeous that is and then I'm going to fold it over. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> We have a beautiful, tight package that's just bursting with flavor. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> I'm going to keep going until I have quite a few done and ready for lunch. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> I've got about 10 done and I'm just going to keep going, I've got a fantastic momentum <time_token_90> <time_token_91> going, I've got one soaking while I'm rolling the other one, I've had a few along the way, <time_token_91> <time_token_92> they are just that delicious, they're light and so fresh tasting. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Now remember as you're rolling it to keep wiping down your board because if your board <time_token_93> <time_token_93> gets really wet it gets very slippery and difficult to roll. <time_token_93>

Welcome to Cha-Cha! <time_token_1> <time_token_2> I'm Sangyala Longa. Today I'm going to show you how to make Vietnamese <time_token_2> <time_token_3> banh mi sandwich. I'm going to make it my own style. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> Then I'm going to fill up with deep fried pork belly. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> It doesn't sound good or what! <time_token_5> <time_token_6> I know I'm always making with Vietnamese barbecue pork <time_token_6> <time_token_8> because that is our favorite all the time but I got this beautiful pork belly right here. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> So I'm going to make it with different pork belly. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> Before we start, I'm going to turn up oven 400 degrees to toast my Vietnamese baguette. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> I also bought the Vietnamese baguette from Vietnamese bakery in Atlanta, Georgia. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> I'm going to heat it up with oil medium high. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> I'm going to just slice it thinly. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> You just need 1 pound of pork belly. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> For the pork belly, I'm not going to season it at all before I fry it. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> Because if you season it and put something on the pork belly, when you deep fry it, the oil gets dirty. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> The pork belly will turn to a black color instead of a nice golden brown. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> So you don't want that hasn't. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> I'm just going to toast it into a marinade sauce that I'm making right now. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> After deep fry it, it actually has all the flavors. Suck it up. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> It smells so good! <time_token_22> <time_token_22> You need 2 cloves of garlic. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> I'm going to add 1 Thai chili. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> 1 tablespoon of sugar. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Nice amount of black pepper. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> 1 tablespoon of fish sauce. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> 2 tablespoons of coconut water. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> Dressing is ready. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> I'm going to slice the cucumber from the sandwich. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> This is a mini gourmet cucumber. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> It's my favorite cucumber to use. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> It's because the skin is really tender. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> The seeds are not that strong. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> It's very, very close to the cucumber I used to use in Korea. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> I'm going to slice some jalapeno. <time_token_35> <time_token_35> It's going to be a little bit more time. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> Right to frying, I'm going to heat up my baguette. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> These are extremely light and crunchy. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> I asked what's your secret of the bread. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> And they were like, oh we can tell you. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> So about 5 minutes, 10 minutes to just crunch up the outside. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> I'm going to deep fry it twice for extra, extra crunch. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> So this is how it looks after first fry. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> I'm going to increase the heat to about medium to medium high. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> So it's 370 degrees. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> And here is the pickled radish and carrot that I always have in my refrigerator. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> Like I have kimchi all the time in my refrigerator. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> It's like that. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> For when I'm eating Korean barbecue or Vietnamese cuisine, <time_token_49> <time_token_50> I use a lot of it. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> So I always eat it. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> And I have a rich recipe already on my website and also on my blog. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> And I'm going to put it down to the description box. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> So please check it out. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Did y'all get them? <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Did y'all get the squirrel? <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Give me some pork belly. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> While my bread is a little cooling down, <time_token_55> <time_token_56> if I can handle it, I'm going to deep fry the rest of the pork belly. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> One more time. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Just make sure they are not sticking each other. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> I'll eat you up. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> I'm so excited. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> Deep fried pork belly. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> My mom is going to kill me. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> Nice and golden brown. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> It's a hot fried pork belly. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> I'm going to direct it into the dressing and toss it. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Let's finish the sandwich. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> I'm going to put mayonnaise. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> I'm going to dash a little bit of veggie sauce. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Not a lot because we're going to put this dressing on it too <time_token_71> <time_token_72> so we want just a little bit of veggie sauce flavor. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> The veggie sauce is a very, very special kind of seasoning sauce. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> It's always in the Vietnamese sandwich. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Give that unique flavor. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> I'm going to put that pork belly in the dressing panel. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> That's so good. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Pickled radish and carrot. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> I'm going to squeeze the excess oil. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Just put on it. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> There's a jalapeno slice which is optional. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> I'm going to put some chicory. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> I just like this bitterness into the salad. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> I mean, sandwich. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> And of course, we're going to finish a bunch of sandwiches. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> We love lots of sandwiches on our damn mini. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> How about you?

Now everyone knows onion rings and it's been requested <time_token_6> <time_token_7> almost on every single video, especially on my mozzarella sticks video, everybody was <time_token_7> <time_token_8> like great, let mozzarella sticks, now onion rings, onion rings, onion rings, onion rings, <time_token_8> <time_token_9> onion rings, everyone loves them, there's so many different ways of making them and <time_token_9> <time_token_11> I myself make them a few different ways, I do like a breadcrumb coating, a beer battered <time_token_11> <time_token_12> or this is more of like a classic battered onion rings, that's what I'm showing you today, <time_token_12> <time_token_13> it's so easy and simple to put together, the ingredients for them are very few, you'll <time_token_13> <time_token_15> just need some all purpose flour, hot sauce of your choice, buttermilk, you'll need some <time_token_15> <time_token_16> granulated onion, garlic, dried parsley, paprika, baking powder, celery, salt and egg, <time_token_16> <time_token_17> a bit more salt and pepper, your onion and some vegetable oil and the oven's preheated <time_token_17> <time_token_18> for a different recipe, so you're going to have to stick around to see what that is. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> Now in here I've got some peanut oil and you can use peanut or you can use vegetable oil, <time_token_20> <time_token_21> canola oil, any light colored oil that can come up to high temperature without smoking <time_token_21> <time_token_22> a lot so you wouldn't want to use olive oil for this because it will be smoking up the <time_token_22> <time_token_23> house and it turns brown and bitter very quickly, so any light colored oil will do, <time_token_23> <time_token_24> I'm using peanut oil today because in a little bit I plan on making some fried chicken and <time_token_24> <time_token_25> I have to have my fried chicken fried in peanut oil, just saying. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> Now the onion is just a big, delicious sweet yellow onion and what I'm going to do to this <time_token_27> <time_token_29> is I'm just going to take off the very first layer, cut the bottom and cut the top, take <time_token_29> <time_token_30> off the very first layer, maybe even two depending if you really need to, like I'm going to take <time_token_30> <time_token_32> off this layer as well, it's got a lot of brown on it, it's pretty thin, I'm just going <time_token_32> <time_token_34> to cut this into big pieces like that and now you can, you know, up to you, if you want <time_token_34> <time_token_35> them really thick you can cut them really thick, if you want them really thin you can <time_token_35> <time_token_36> cut them thinner, doesn't really matter, it really sometimes just depends on my mood, <time_token_36> <time_token_38> sometimes they go really thick, sometimes they go thin, just going to separate them <time_token_38> <time_token_40> and I'm just going to put this on my plate, so going to be so good, I'm so excited, you <time_token_40> <time_token_41> know, a lot of people ask, oh can you show us some healthier recipes, healthier recipes, <time_token_41> <time_token_42> but I think what most people forget is that to upload a new recipe every other day you <time_token_42> <time_token_44> got to do a little bit of everything and I want to please my audience and everyone asks <time_token_44> <time_token_45> for fried chicken and onion rings and french fries and I want to show those recipes to <time_token_45> <time_token_46> you and share them with you, but I'm certainly not advertising that you eat them every day, <time_token_46> <time_token_48> in fact it's been a very long time since I've made homemade onion rings, just because fried <time_token_48> <time_token_49> food around here is a treat, we definitely don't order when we're out, we don't order <time_token_49> <time_token_50> fried food on a regular basis and I prefer to make things at home as you all know, so <time_token_51> <time_token_52> you know, if I'm filling up to it I'll make some fried chicken, nothing wrong with that, <time_token_52> <time_token_53> moderation, lots of exercise, works wonders. Alright, this is fine, I'm going to save these <time_token_53> <time_token_55> to make a sauce, otherwise be a little bit much. Alright, that's it going on our batter, <time_token_55> <time_token_56> I've got my all purpose flour here and I've got some buttermilk and buttermilk is the <time_token_56> <time_token_58> key for a really delicious light and fluffy batter and also the baking powder is really <time_token_58> <time_token_59> important as well and as far as spices, the world is your pickle, I mean if you like certain <time_token_59> <time_token_61> spices add those, I mean I love that combination, so that's what I use. A good pinch of salt <time_token_61> <time_token_63> is really important and lots of freshly cracked black pepper, you could use white pepper here <time_token_63> <time_token_65> as well and a little bit of hot sauce, I love sriracha so that's what I'm using, you could <time_token_65> <time_token_66> use Tabasco, you can use any kind of hot sauce you want, so now I'm just going to mix this <time_token_66> <time_token_68> up until it's pretty lump free so give it a good minute, that looks great, it's really <time_token_68> <time_token_69> nice and smooth, now I've got my oil up to temperature, I can kind of already gauge what <time_token_69> <time_token_70> the temperature should be, I'm going to add an onion in there if it's got color right <time_token_70> <time_token_72> away and if it's bubbling up right away then it's good. If you're using a thermometer you <time_token_72> <time_token_73> want this to be about 375, so this is what I'm going to do, I'm going to dip my onion <time_token_73> <time_token_75> ring in my batter, that's what you're looking for and I'm just going to continue to do this <time_token_75> <time_token_77> and then cook them for just a couple of minutes until they develop a good golden brown color <time_token_77> <time_token_78> and then I've got a baking pan here, just with some paper towels on it because I want <time_token_78> <time_token_79> to put the cooked onion rings on that to drain any excess oil and do it in batches because <time_token_79> <time_token_81> you don't want to overcrowd the pan, otherwise it's going to defeat the purpose of being <time_token_81> <time_token_82> nice and crispy because you'll drop the temperature of the oil and they'll get really soggy, so <time_token_82> <time_token_84> be patient my friend, so you're going to last two off, I know, I know, it's killing me too <time_token_85> <time_token_87> because I know I can't eat the whole thing, look at them, I've got this one, I actually <time_token_87> <time_token_89> want this one, the little tiny ones like this are my favorite, I know, mmm, mmm, I'm going <time_token_89> <time_token_91> to try a crunch, I'm going to go in for one more, personally I don't like onion rings dipped <time_token_91> <time_token_93> in anything, my husband would probably choose ketchup, let me know what your favorite thing <time_token_93> <time_token_94> is to dip onion rings in, but that's it, they're very simple and easy to put together, head <time_token_94> <time_token_95> on over to OurInTheKitchen.com to get the recipe, as always I hope you enjoyed spending <time_token_95> <time_token_96> time with me because I certainly enjoyed spending time with you, I'll see you next time, bye-bye.

<time_token_92> <time_token_92> Oh, yes, please. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> Oh, it's hot though. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> As best of things as you said, right? <time_token_93> <time_token_93> Yep, that's it. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> And that was so quick to do.

So this is it my dad loved to cook for us <time_token_2> <time_token_2> My dad passed away about three years ago <time_token_2> <time_token_4> But he loved to cook and this is one of his favorite meals to make especially when my sister and I were living in California <time_token_4> <time_token_5> We would come all the way across the country come home <time_token_5> <time_token_6> There's my dad with my husband David that was at our wedding shower in Atlanta <time_token_6> <time_token_8> Which is where he brought us a copy of the New York Times cookbook and that for him that <time_token_8> <time_token_10> Recipe in the book was always the basis for his beef burgundy or as he preferred to say both <time_token_10> <time_token_12> Bologna because he'd like to say it in French there is cooking in my in my kitchen in San Francisco with the red cabinet <time_token_12> <time_token_14> So in honor of my dad, we're making both bone. You know this morning in winter meal <time_token_14> <time_token_16> Yeah, I do have some French in me and I do speak French and my sister lives in France very well <time_token_16> <time_token_17> So we have a big love for all things French in my family <time_token_17> <time_token_17> This is got French wine in it <time_token_17> <time_token_18> So you can't go wrong <time_token_18> <time_token_19> Which is why we're each starting out with a glass of wine because my dad would also recommend perhaps <time_token_19> <time_token_21> Having a glass of something as you're cooking. It certainly can't hear <time_token_21> <time_token_23> Take as we would say in France first you want to start with your meat <time_token_23> <time_token_23> So the first thing that you're gonna do Tom, sorry <time_token_23> <time_token_24> I'm giving you the wine and making you put it down <time_token_24> <time_token_26> That's right. You want it you want to salt and pepper it right on both sides and one little trick <time_token_26> <time_token_27> I learned from our good friend Bobby Flay to get high pie. You want to do it high when you salt it <time_token_27> <time_token_28> So you salt and pepper this? <time_token_28> <time_token_30> You would do it on both sides in the interest of time on television <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Yeah, then you take it you're gonna put it in a bag with about a third of a cup of flour <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Huber a bunch I would do them several at a time. Okay, otherwise it would take you all day <time_token_33> <time_token_33> Get them in there <time_token_33> <time_token_35> What you're gonna do is shake it around cook them really well and that what you would do what Lester's already involved in <time_token_35> <time_token_37> Oh, yeah, I've been doing a little bit of bacon in the pan and one of my well-loved red <time_token_37> <time_token_39> Yeah, and then after you take the bacon out in that bacon grease a little extra olive oil you start browning the meat <time_token_39> <time_token_41> So we've got some browns right so Lester once it gets round you want to start to take it out <time_token_41> <time_token_42> So we'll take it out and put it in here and you want to try to leave some of the juice in here as you <time_token_42> <time_token_44> Take the meat out and that's because we're gonna use that <time_token_44> <time_token_45> To get a little bit more flavor from the from the rest of the dish. I'm just moving in here my friend <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Yeah, please cuz I'm too slow. I don't know <time_token_48> <time_token_49> So we take all the meat out and then you're gonna take some brandy here <time_token_49> <time_token_52> This goes into the pot and you're going to de-glaze the pot so porting kind of slowly and then the whole time the brandy's <time_token_52> <time_token_53> In there. You just want to scrape up those yummy brown <time_token_53> <time_token_55> Okay, and so this will take you up a couple of minutes <time_token_55> <time_token_57> And this will actually turn into a nice lovely sort of creamy concoction as you're getting all these bits together <time_token_59> <time_token_60> It's gonna burn off a little bit yeah <time_token_60> <time_token_62> So what we would do then is we put some mix some of that in with the meat what we're gonna do now is and <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Then what would be left in the pan would kind of clean up the pan a little bit <time_token_63> <time_token_64> If I for TV add some butter and olive oil <time_token_65> <time_token_67> And then Dylan's gonna put the vegetables in we've got leaks. We've got onions carrots <time_token_67> <time_token_69> Put it all in what ends that tomato paste that tomato paste is coming after so we're gonna cook our vegetables for a little bit <time_token_69> <time_token_71> Then you would add in the tomato paste. Okay leaks and garlic leaks and garlic you're gonna cook it all down <time_token_71> <time_token_72> So it's really soft <time_token_72> <time_token_74> Then we would put the meat and the bacon back in along with a number of different herbs and spices <time_token_74> <time_token_77> I use ground cloves bay leaves a lot of time a lot of parsley you're gonna throw in we would put it <time_token_78> <time_token_80> Yes, but you know we're actually gonna do we're gonna move down here in the interest of time so we put all these things in <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Cook it for 20 minutes throw in the oven for about an hour <time_token_81> <time_token_83> You saw taste some onions and some mushrooms still and we throw those mushrooms in <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Add a minute at the end <time_token_83> <time_token_85> Give it a good mix. I'm gonna steal the spoon and voila you have beef burgundy. It's all <time_token_85> <time_token_87> It's a very hearty meal and one of the best things you could do is make it ahead <time_token_87> <time_token_89> I actually made mine on Tuesday.

<time_token_2> penny and let's work that ass if you're scared of this place, and no need to bother, just <time_token_2> <time_token_2> lay down your weapons and pick up another. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> Hi guys how's it going welcome to my virgin kitchen, today I'm going to be showing you <time_token_3> <time_token_3> how to make a classic British dinner, it's called bangers and mash, you might not have <time_token_3> <time_token_4> heard of it but it's basically mashed potato with sausages and it's called bangers because <time_token_4> <time_token_4> when you cook them in a pan that's the sort of noise it used to make if you cook them <time_token_4> <time_token_5> really fast, sort of bang right, so just call it sausages and mash if you get confused, <time_token_5> <time_token_5> I'm going to have it with a really cool gravy, it's really cheap, really filling, really <time_token_5> <time_token_6> yummy so perfect for students, old people, animals, whatever you want to be and you're <time_token_6> <time_token_6> going to love it. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> This is little Chloe, she's told me how to make the recipe, she's about to go to bed, <time_token_6> <time_token_7> once you rock her to sleep I'm going to come back to the kitchen, I'll show you how to <time_token_7> <time_token_7> make this thing. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> Right here then folks let's get on and make this recipe, it is going to be so so easy <time_token_8> <time_token_8> even a monkey could do it, I don't even want to think about that but a monkey probably <time_token_8> <time_token_9> could do it, anyhow you're just going to need 3 pans and we'll get to them as and when, <time_token_9> <time_token_9> one of them has got a pan of boiling water in it and we're going to put our potatoes <time_token_9> <time_token_10> in there, so I'm going to mash my potato I'm going to have a bit of a rustic feel to it, <time_token_10> <time_token_10> give them a wash and leave the skin on alternatively peel it if you don't want that skin in there, <time_token_10> <time_token_11> make sure there's no mud on it because that won't taste good, just going to boil them <time_token_11> <time_token_11> up mash it up with some other special ingredients in a bit, we've got our frying pan there which <time_token_11> <time_token_12> is going to use for our sausages which we're going to cook first of all, the frying pan <time_token_12> <time_token_12> the old classic banger method, you could put them in the oven under the grill if you want <time_token_12> <time_token_13> any way you want, this is prime, ok so you can see my pan is nice and hot there the good <time_token_13> <time_token_14> thing about this recipe is you can really go to town on it you can make it as bland <time_token_14> <time_token_14> or as amazing as you want you can basically just have potatoes mashed with sausages or <time_token_14> <time_token_15> you can really twist the flavours on the head which is what we're hopefully going to do <time_token_15> <time_token_16> make it taste real good for you, ok so that pan is hot I've got my sausages here so I'm <time_token_16> <time_token_16> just going to drop one in like so just so you get the idea, going to cook them so they're <time_token_16> <time_token_17> nice and gone brown all the way around on the side and while they're cooking we can <time_token_17> <time_token_17> work on our gravy and our potatoes, yeah I better put more sausages in otherwise it's <time_token_17> <time_token_18> getting a bit of a lonely sausage right there, yeah. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Ok amazing so all the sausages in the pan they've literally only just dropped in there <time_token_18> <time_token_19> they're sort of putting their suntan lotion on ready to go into the sun they're ready <time_token_19> <time_token_19> and I hope you are too, I don't know what I meant by that but let's just go along with <time_token_19> <time_token_20> it anyhow you saw that pan of water was boiling I put three out of the four of my potatoes <time_token_20> <time_token_20> in let's just drop the other one in there like that so the temperature does go down <time_token_20> <time_token_21> a little bit you have to notice though that the water level was actually quite low because <time_token_21> <time_token_21> when you put the potatoes in it goes kind of like a fat person getting the swimming <time_token_21> <time_token_22> So what we're going to do is bring that up to the boil getting all nice to cook through <time_token_22> <time_token_22> which will take about 15 minutes then we mash away, let's move on to our gravy the sausages <time_token_22> <time_token_23> are staying on there on their own we're going to keep them quite bland, yes. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> Ok then guys so right behind me you've got the pan the sausages cooking away the potatoes <time_token_23> <time_token_24> bubbling away too and there's one other pan here which I've just started to warm up we're <time_token_24> <time_token_24> going to add some oil in there and we're going to add our onions and our leeks to start to <time_token_24> <time_token_25> build our gravy ok it's going to be nice you're going to love it. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Ok so close up on that pan now it's nice and warm so I'm just going to pour in just <time_token_26> <time_token_27> under a tablespoon of oil and right here I've got myself a chopped onion and a chopped leek <time_token_27> <time_token_27> so I'm just going to push them in gradually I'm probably knowing me going to get it everywhere <time_token_27> <time_token_28> but just get it in oh that's not so bad I'm normally really messy get it everywhere but <time_token_28> <time_token_29> so far so good yeah that is all in there so cook it away fry it away get it softened and <time_token_29> <time_token_29> more stuff will add to it fluid stuff fantastic so the leeks and the onions are all in there <time_token_29> <time_token_30> you can see they're starting to soften already but we want them so soft baby we want them <time_token_30> <time_token_31> softer than chloe's bum right now so so soft oh yeah ok let's show you where we are so <time_token_31> <time_token_31> the leeks and the onions as we know are breaking down we're going to come and add a little <time_token_31> <time_token_32> bit of butter to those in just a minute but if we just robot dance like that you can see <time_token_32> <time_token_32> the sausages have been turning them and they're on a very low heat by the way I've got to <time_token_32> <time_token_33> mention that just so we can time it we can always crank it up if we need to but we want <time_token_33> <time_token_33> to try and finish it all together ok we'll just move up a little bit for a try you can <time_token_33> <time_token_34> see the potatoes over there still cooking away it's all working well so we'll come <time_token_34> <time_token_35> back to our onions and leeks now and I'll let go of the tripod yeah ok so the banger <time_token_35> <time_token_36> noise I was talking about listen to this baby can you hear that yeah that's bangers ok so <time_token_36> <time_token_36> we're going to add a little bit of fun and games to the leeks and onions I don't know <time_token_36> <time_token_37> why I said fun and games but it is fun and games right so they're nice and soft they're <time_token_37> <time_token_37> loving it they're just so floppy they're like this blah blah blah so what we're going to <time_token_37> <time_token_38> do is add in a knob of butter straight in like that and that will melt in and what an <time_token_38> <time_token_39> onion just jumped down ok don't worry about it that doesn't have to happen for you but <time_token_39> <time_token_40> anyhow let the heat sort of melt that down stir it all through and one other cheeky thing <time_token_40> <time_token_40> I'm going to add is I've got a little bit of golden syrup aka corn syrup in other countries <time_token_40> <time_token_41> just add a little squidgen of that in there for a really naughty cheeky spanky kick stir <time_token_41> <time_token_42> it through okie doke that has only been two minutes you can see that butter is bubbling <time_token_42> <time_token_42> away in there it's full of flavour there's like a sugary ooziness as well from that little <time_token_42> <time_token_43> bit of golden syrup absolutely loving it it's going to taste so good so grab yourself 500 <time_token_43> <time_token_44> mils of water and just pour that in like so what we're going to do is add a stock cube <time_token_44> <time_token_45> in with this now as well and also a cheeky little ingredient yeah ok then folks so before <time_token_45> <time_token_45> we sim it down our gravy we're going to add two other things one of them is a stock cube <time_token_45> <time_token_46> which is in my hands right now just going to chuck that in like that half of it is in <time_token_46> <time_token_46> my spatula but it's all good stir that through but before we bring it to a simmer one other <time_token_46> <time_token_47> thing remember this is completely optional but I'm going to add some marmite ok I've <time_token_47> <time_token_47> added it before it gives it a cheeky little kick but you can also do soy sauce or Worcester <time_token_47> <time_token_48> sauce or some balsamic vinegar lots of different things you can add let's just try some marmite <time_token_48> <time_token_49> today and I think you're going to love it a little spoonful of that in there wow ok <time_token_49> <time_token_49> so I've got my marmite there it's just over a teaspoon just going to push that straight <time_token_49> <time_token_50> in there like that I think in Australia you call that guys a veggie mite marmite I don't <time_token_50> <time_token_51> know but let's uh anyway stir it through simmer it and it should start thickening now baby <time_token_51> <time_token_51> right here my friends it's been five minutes the gravy is simmering away it is hot in here <time_token_51> <time_token_52> but it's cold outside so that's a good thing right check out the gravy look if I give it <time_token_52> <time_token_52> a little stir you can see the onions and the leeks rising to the top that is the texture <time_token_52> <time_token_53> I'm after I want it not too thick not too thin but if you want it thicker maybe add <time_token_53> <time_token_54> less water maybe some flour it's up to you one thing I am going to add to it right now <time_token_54> <time_token_54> though is a little bit of sage you can use fresh sage leaves if you like but I'm just <time_token_54> <time_token_55> going to pour this in straight out the tub give it a little stir around give it a nice <time_token_55> <time_token_55> little funky boost whoosh I think that goes like that our sausages are cooking away good <time_token_55> <time_token_56> thing cooking them like that I can just keep turning them getting really nice and dark <time_token_56> <time_token_57> and funky but it's kind of like a slow cooker approach the potatoes I've just sliced in <time_token_57> <time_token_57> half they're already I've checked them so we're ready to mush them and we can bring <time_token_57> <time_token_58> this together right home folks you can probably see here I've got a giant salad bowl and <time_token_58> <time_token_58> I've put our potatoes in it you can see as well that the skin look it just wants to peel <time_token_58> <time_token_59> off like this so when we mash it up all that skin is going to break down let's make some <time_token_59> <time_token_60> funky mash ok so using the heat of the potatoes there we are going to chuck in a block of <time_token_60> <time_token_61> butter like so pour in 100ml of single cream you can use milk a heaped teaspoon of whole <time_token_61> <time_token_61> grain mustard choe choeing in that goes and just another teaspoon of sage in there so <time_token_61> <time_token_62> just sprinkle that in and then we get to mash it here we go so I'm just breaking it down <time_token_62> <time_token_63> merging all of these ingredients together you can see how the skin is just falling off <time_token_63> <time_token_63> you want all those flavours to merge make sure that butter gets all in there oh my goodness <time_token_63> <time_token_64> this is looking good it's kind of fun ok guys after mashing it together wow

all day, <time_token_3> <time_token_4> sometimes you don't wanna cook, <time_token_4> <time_token_7> but ordering takeout can be so fattening and unhealthy. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> And this is Pad Thai, this is ordering in Thai food. <time_token_9> <time_token_11> It's a really fattening noodle dish from Thai restaurants, <time_token_11> <time_token_12> and it has peanuts, and it has kind of like <time_token_12> <time_token_14> a brown, sticky sauce, and it's delicious, <time_token_14> <time_token_14> but to make it at home, <time_token_14> <time_token_16> it's a drastic, drastic difference in calories, <time_token_16> <time_token_17> and it can be fun for kids. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> All right, so these are vermicelli rice noodles. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> A lot of people are gluten-free now, <time_token_20> <time_token_21> and rice noodles are great if you're gluten-free, <time_token_21> <time_token_23> and they have a great texture, I happen to love them. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> And then here's a little topping bar. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> So you're gonna make your Pad Thai noodles. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> They're a little bit wet, drain them, but not completely, <time_token_27> <time_token_28> because I'm not using a lot of fat. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> Toasted sesame oil, you gotta use the toasted, <time_token_29> <time_token_31> because it has that really sesame flavor. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> Tablespoon of soy sauce, get the reduced sodium one <time_token_33> <time_token_33> so your ankles don't swell. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> Okay, this is half a teaspoon of fish sauce. <time_token_35> <time_token_37> In a lot of Asian recipes, there's an interesting flavor <time_token_37> <time_token_38> that you can't figure out what it is, <time_token_38> <time_token_39> and it's fish sauce, and it sounds scary, <time_token_39> <time_token_40> and it sounds fishy, but it's not. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> Honey, a teaspoon of honey, needs that sweetness. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> A lot of Asian food has that sweetness, <time_token_43> <time_token_45> and they put a lot of MSG and stuff in it, <time_token_45> <time_token_46> so this is actually pretty healthy. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Half a teaspoon of lime juice. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Thai food has a lot of lime, and then chili paste. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> Half a teaspoon of chili paste for that zip. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Okay, then with your, oh, sorry, I forgot this. <time_token_52> <time_token_54> Garlic clove, half a teaspoon of crushed ginger, <time_token_54> <time_token_55> and quarter teaspoon of pepper. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> I'm not adding salt because the soy sauce has salt. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> Okay, now this is the fun part with your kids, <time_token_59> <time_token_60> and you can use whatever you have. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Here's some chicken, bean sprouts, <time_token_61> <time_token_63> if you have broccoli, there are carrots, <time_token_63> <time_token_64> and I find that when you involve your kids <time_token_64> <time_token_66> and let them kinda mix it up with you, they wanna eat it. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> So it has cilantro, which not everyone likes. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Use what you have. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> These are chopped cashews. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> You can use peanuts, whatever nuts you like. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Okay, this takes five seconds to make. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> It is so delicious and flavorful that you can't believe it <time_token_74> <time_token_75> that I have to have somebody from the audience try it. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> And I do this for my daughter. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> You take a little piece of paper, roll it up, <time_token_78> <time_token_79> and do the rubber bands, because the chopsticks, <time_token_79> <time_token_80> it's cute for kids to learn. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> And for adults, eating with chopsticks <time_token_82> <time_token_83> makes you eat much more slowly, and you end up eating less. <time_token_84> <time_token_87> So takeout pad thai has 950 calories and 30 grams of fat. <time_token_88> <time_token_91> My takeout fakeout has 142 calories and five grams of fat. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> That's a big difference.

Welcome to my kitchen. Today I will be making dal makhni. Very popular <time_token_3> <time_token_7> dish. Usually served with naan or tandoori roti. This recipe will serve 2-3. Here I have <time_token_7> <time_token_11> 1.5 cups of whole urad dal, 1.8 cups of rajma, kidney beans, 3.4 tablespoons of salt, 1.5 <time_token_11> <time_token_14> tablespoons of turmeric, 1 teaspoon shredded ginger, 1 green chilli shredded or chopped <time_token_14> <time_token_19> very fine, 1.4 cups of heavy cream, 1.5 teaspoons of mango powder, 1.4 teaspoons of garam masala, <time_token_19> <time_token_24> 2 tablespoons of ghee, pinch of hing, 1.5 teaspoons of cumin seeds, 3 whole red chillies. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> For garnishing I have 1 teaspoon of shredded ginger. I have already washed and soaked the <time_token_26> <time_token_29> urad dal and rajma for about 8 hours. After soaking this will become almost double in <time_token_29> <time_token_32> volume. So we are going to cook this in pressure cooker. On medium high with 3 cups of water. <time_token_34> <time_token_42> Green chilli, ginger, turmeric, salt. After pressure cooker starts leaving the steam <time_token_42> <time_token_45> turn down the heat to medium and cook for about 25 minutes. So steam is out. We open <time_token_45> <time_token_45> the pressure cooker. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> Dal is soft and tender. But we need to mash this little bit to make it creamy. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> And let it cook on low medium heat for about 5 minutes. <time_token_55> <time_token_58> Dal has been cooking for about 4 minutes. Let's add cream, mango powder, <time_token_58> <time_token_62> and garam masala. Mix it well. And let it cook for another few minutes on low heat. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Dal is ready. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> And now we are going to make chomp or seasoning for dal. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> Heat is on, medium high. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Let's add the ghee. <time_token_73> <time_token_76> And wait till ghee is hot. Ghee should be hot but not smoking. <time_token_76> <time_token_79> Just to check if ghee is ready just drop couple of cumin seeds. And you see they are already sizzling. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> And red chilli. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> Just stir for few seconds. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Seasoning is ready. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> Dal is looking great. I am going to garnish this with some shredded ginger. I like the <time_token_91> <time_token_94> bite of ginger. Dal makhni is a favorite dish with my family. And today I will be <time_token_94> <time_token_97> serving this with tandoori roti. Thank you. And I will see you again with a new recipe.

This happens to be the most Austrian dish you can try and I highly recommend <time_token_5> <time_token_7> you try if you get a chance. For this recipe, you'll need some meat, which I'll talk about <time_token_7> <time_token_10> in a second, some salt and obviously some pepper, about 2 cups of breadcrumbs, 2 cups <time_token_10> <time_token_12> of all purpose flour, just something you have in your pantry, nothing too fancy and 3-4 <time_token_12> <time_token_15> eggs depending on the size and also some lard. We use something similar to concentrated butter <time_token_15> <time_token_18> but lard or a good quality oil can also be used. For high efficiency, I recommend you <time_token_18> <time_token_21> set up 3 stations using 2 sheets of aluminum foil and a deep plate. Begin by whisking the <time_token_21> <time_token_24> eggs in the deep plate and lightly season with some salt. Then transfer both the flour <time_token_29> <time_token_32> and the breadcrumbs to the 2 aluminum sheets. Now season the meat. For this recipe, we use <time_token_32> <time_token_34> turkey meat, however traditionally either veal or pork would be used. Lightly season <time_token_34> <time_token_37> with salt and if you like, a little bit of pepper. Now you can take the meat and completely <time_token_37> <time_token_39> cover it with the flour. Dust off any excess and then immediately dunk it into the whisked <time_token_39> <time_token_41> eggs. Again, let any excess strip off the flour and let it dry completely. <time_token_43> <time_token_46> Transfer to the breadcrumbs. You'll want to ensure that the meat is completely and evenly <time_token_46> <time_token_48> covered in the breadcrumbs and I find this is easiest if you use your fingers to really <time_token_48> <time_token_50> pat the breadcrumbs into the meat. Then transfer the breaded meat onto a plate and continue <time_token_50> <time_token_53> doing the same with the rest. For the full recipe, you can visit my blog healthinspirations.net <time_token_54> <time_token_55> where I have the recipe including the exact quantities. I'll have a link to my blog and <time_token_55> <time_token_57> all my social media channels in the information bar below so check that out if you're interested. <time_token_58> <time_token_61> When you're done breading the meat, you can heat up the lard in a large deep pan. Make <time_token_61> <time_token_63> sure not to heat it up too high otherwise you'll burn the meat. A good way to test whether <time_token_63> <time_token_64> the lard or the oil is hot enough is to simply sprinkle some of the dry breadcrumbs into <time_token_64> <time_token_66> the oil and when they start sizzling you can start frying the meat. <time_token_69> <time_token_72> Fry the schnitzel for about 4 to 5 minutes on medium heat until just golden and then <time_token_72> <time_token_75> carefully flip over onto the other side trying not to splatter oil over your kitchen. Fry <time_token_75> <time_token_75> for another 4 minutes on the other side. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> Transfer the schnitzel onto a plate covered with a few layers of kitchen roll to prevent <time_token_79> <time_token_80> a big puddle of oil from forming. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Whilst you're cooking the rest of the meat, you can transfer the cooked schnitzel to a <time_token_83> <time_token_85> preheated oven which will ensure that they stay warm and crispy.

This is the real thing, and no tomato <time_token_16> <time_token_19> paste here. Try this served with rustic bread or noodles. <time_token_19> <time_token_25> To begin, heat a large pot over medium heat.

She has added more water and now it is stirring it with <time_token_17> <time_token_22> the floor and now she is kneading it. Take the side floor into the middle with the wet <time_token_22> <time_token_26> floor and knead it. Now insert more water and start kneading it. We will have to add <time_token_26> <time_token_29> water till it gets a medium, not soft, not very hard consistency. We are not adding salt <time_token_29> <time_token_32> and oil in our dough because regularly if we knead the dough so it will be not much <time_token_32> <time_token_40> healthy if we add salt and oil in our flour. So this is a little much hard dough. Now she <time_token_40> <time_token_46> will add little more water on the top so that it becomes slightly soft and we will <time_token_46> <time_token_52> kept it under the lid for 15 minutes.

"asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_1> Hi, I'm Diane Cometta and today on Dish It With Dye I'm making pasta bazool, pasta and <time_token_1> <time_token_2> This is an easy one-pot meal that's perfect for a weeknight. <time_token_2> <time_token_2> So let's get started. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> You need some canned cannellini beans, some tomato sauce, some ditalini, which is a small <time_token_7> <time_token_9> tube pasta, a dried bay leaf, some fresh garlic and some chicken broth or chicken stock. <time_token_9> <time_token_11> You're also going to need some celery, carrot and onion and I have some fresh herbs here. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> Now I have some fresh rosemary and fresh thyme. <time_token_11> <time_token_13> And I actually keep mine in the freezer after I purchase it and I wrap it in some foil and <time_token_13> <time_token_15> put it in a freezer safe bag so whenever I need it I can just unwrap it and take it out. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> So that's what I did today. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Another thing I have here is some pancetta. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> This is an Italian bacon and it's diced really small. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> If you don't want to use this, you don't have to. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> You can either substitute and use some regular bacon, that's a little bit more fatty though. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Or you can just leave this out. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> I've left it out plenty of times and it still tastes really good so don't worry about this <time_token_21> <time_token_21> part of it. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> And I have some salt, pepper and olive oil. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> Now what we're going to do first is take the celery, carrot and onion and we're going <time_token_23> <time_token_24> to, actually I'm going to put mine in my mini food processor here and I'm going to <time_token_24> <time_token_25> cut it up really small. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> So if you don't have one, just cut it up really fine. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> So I have to give it a rough chop first before I put it in there. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> Almost forgot, you want to put the garlic in there as well. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> So if you're doing it by hand, just mince your garlic up really fine. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> Now I'm going to go over the stove and we're going to get this whole thing started. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> I have a pot heating over medium heat and I'm adding some olive oil in. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> And now I'm going to add in my pancetta. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> And you just want this to cook for a few minutes until the pancetta gets nice and brown. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> The pancetta is nice and brown now and you see all the little brown bits on the bottom, <time_token_37> <time_token_37> that's what you want. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> That's lots of flavor and the pancetta gives it a really nice smoky taste. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> So now what we're going to do is add in the vegetables and the garlic. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> So just put that in there and we're going to put our herbs in there as well. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> I'm just going to give that a little stir around. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> Now they're on the stems like that because we're going to take those out at the end. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> So you don't want to chop them up or anything like that, you just leave them in their hole <time_token_46> <time_token_47> and then when we're all done, we just yank them right back out. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> It steams up a little bit at first, whoops, there's a carrot that didn't get chopped up. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> Get that out of there. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> Okay, so this is just going to cook for a few minutes, three minutes until it gets a <time_token_51> <time_token_51> little soft and it's nice and fragrant. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> Just going to add a little bit of salt in there and some fresh pepper. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> You just season this to taste and just give that a little quick stir around. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> And this is something that I've made plenty of times on a weeknight and I come home from <time_token_57> <time_token_58> work and I just do it really quick and boom, it's done. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> So now we're ready for the next step and I'm going to add in the chicken broth. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> And then you're also going to add in your sauce at this point and the beans. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Now just give that a stir and then we're going to raise the heat up to like medium high and <time_token_63> <time_token_64> you're going to bring this up to a boil and believe it or not, we're almost done. <time_token_65> <time_token_67> Okay, it started to boil and now I'm going to add in the pasta and you're just going <time_token_67> <time_token_68> to let this cook for about 10 minutes or until the pasta is tender. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Then we're ready to serve it up. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> That was literally about 30 minutes altogether. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> So what I like to do is I have some nice, fresh, crusty Italian bread here and I have <time_token_72> <time_token_73> some fresh Parmesan cheese. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> So I take my Parmesan cheese and I just grate that on the top. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> And now it's time for a little taste. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> Oh, it's a little hot. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> But it's really good, I promise. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> I hurt my tongue, I think. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> The one thing I want to tell you real quick is that when you're cooking it, make sure <time_token_83> <time_token_84> that you scrape the bottom a little bit because sometimes the beans will sit on the bottom <time_token_84> <time_token_85> when you're boiling the pasta and you want to make sure that they don't stick down there. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> So just get your spatula or your spoon and just scrape that up real good. <time_token_86> <time_token_89> But really delicious, rich and perfect for a weeknight but you can certainly have this <time_token_89> <time_token_89> any time you want. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> It's a wonderful comfort food and you could use low sodium chicken broth. <time_token_90> <time_token_92> They have now white pasta that has extra fiber in it or you could use a whole wheat pasta.

Enjoy your sushi. <time_token_15> <time_token_21> Let's prepare some salmon sashimi. This salmon has been bought from a supermarket, I always <time_token_21> <time_token_25> choose salmon that has got a long sell by date on it, then you know obviously you've <time_token_25> <time_token_27> got the freshest of it, that means reaching to the back of the shelves in a chilled cabinet <time_token_27> <time_token_32> why not. Lovely fresh, you should smell the fresh of the sea, you shouldn't smell of fish. <time_token_32> <time_token_39> So this is how we do it, first of all we cut and try to do it in one stroke, along <time_token_39> <time_token_46> that way, again there, again one stroke, don't cut through the skin underneath because that <time_token_46> <time_token_51> helps it stay together while you're making the slices and hold back the last piece there <time_token_51> <time_token_55> very carefully. And now you'll notice with salmon there has to be a dark piece here, <time_token_55> <time_token_61> so what I try to do is cut and avoid the darker piece of meat there and then take the cut <time_token_61> <time_token_67> along the skin in long strokes like that, that's one set and then start a little bit <time_token_67> <time_token_71> higher there and then bring it down and then again hold the salmon together and in long <time_token_72> <time_token_78> strokes there. There you have a nicely laid out salmon sashimi set and you would serve <time_token_78> <time_token_84> that literally by just laying them on this side and slightly separating them, and you <time_token_84> <time_token_88> would arrange those on a nice plate with some daikon radish grated.

Today we're going to be making everyone's favorite, a margarita pizza. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> Homemade pizza is so fun and exciting to make and after you've mastered the basics <time_token_2> <time_token_3> you can do whatever you want and add anything on it. And <time_token_3> <time_token_5> just like always, only thing we need are a few simple ingredients. So let's get started. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> Now the first step we're going to have to do is rolling out our dough and <time_token_6> <time_token_7> with that we need to generously flour out our workspace area. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> This is going to help prevent a dough from sticking when we're rolling it out. And <time_token_8> <time_token_9> so now that we have a generous amount of flour on the bottom, we're also going to have to add flour to the top. <time_token_9> <time_token_11> There we go, just like that. I just simply press with our fingertips working our way from the inside out and nice circular motion. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> I'm just trying to create a nice base circle at the moment and flip it over and doing the same. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> nice little trick of what I found that helps me a lot whenever I'm rolling out my dough is <time_token_15> <time_token_16> this little wine bottle. Actually, yeah. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> Use it for drinking, use it for working. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> There you go. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> So you see how I just roll it back and forth, spin it around little half circles and <time_token_19> <time_token_20> when you get one side moving and coming alive, we could just flip it over. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> See, nice gentle circle. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Make sure we add a little bit more flour to the bottom of the cutting board. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> Yeah, it's going to help prevent it from sticking a little bit more on top as well. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Spread it across. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> And right now, I'm just going to try to stretch it by hand and <time_token_26> <time_token_27> just try to balance out. There's some thicker parts and thinner parts of the dough. You just sort of massage it through different spots. <time_token_27> <time_token_29> It's good to be gentle with it, but you also want to take control and let the dough know where it needs to move. <time_token_30> <time_token_30> There you go. <time_token_30> <time_token_30> Finish it up just like that. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Now what I like to do is sprinkle the pizza tray with a bit of semolina. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> What this semolina flour is going to do is just going to help this dough to slide on and off very very easily. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> You see that? <time_token_34> <time_token_36> Now it's time to add the sauce. Simply just grab a ladle and start in from the middle, work its way from inside out. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Work it in a circular motion. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> You can add as much or as little sauce as you like. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> I like my pizza nice and moist, so I'm going to add a little bit more than some people might. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> See those chunks right there? That's a garlic-comb feet. It's going to be so yummy and tasty. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> Just explosions of garlic. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> Now let's add our mozzarella cheese. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> Simply just place it on the outside, making a nice circle, a nice little ring around it, and <time_token_45> <time_token_45> working its way around. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> You see, I'm a native New Yorker, so of course I like a lot of cheese on mine. <time_token_46> <time_token_48> But if you like, you could hold back on a bit of cheese, and it's totally fine. <time_token_48> <time_token_50> Remember, this is your pizza that you're going to be making at home, so add as much and as little as you like to whichever you want. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> There we are. Now just remember, make sure we add a little bit of seasoning as well. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> A little bit of salt always. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> Everything needs to get seasoned. And a few cracks of fresh cracked black pepper. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Now the star ingredient to finish this margarita pizza off is going to be our basil. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> The red, green, and white symbolize the Italian flag, so make sure that every bite gets a little bit of everything. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> There we go. <time_token_61> <time_token_64> Basil also adds a really nice refreshing flavor to whatever you're eating, and when you roast in this oven right here, it's going to add a really whole other completely different texture of flavor. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> You're really going to enjoy it, I believe. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> And let's just add one more for good measure, right in the middle. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> There we go. Perfect. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> And there she is. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> Good old beautiful margarita pizza. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> Let's get ready to put her in the oven. <time_token_68> <time_token_71> So, in a 475 degree oven, I'm just going to put this in my pizza stone, and the semolina is really helping this come off very smoothly. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Place that in. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> There we are. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> Put it in. Let it hang out for about 8 minutes. It should be perfect. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Some ovens are different, but check yours for about 8 minutes. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> And check this out. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> This has got a really nice crust to the bottom of it as well. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Look at this gooeyness. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> That's the New Yorker in me with the cheese pizza. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> Check out this beautiful crust right here. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> Alright, let's dig in. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> So, quite simply, cut it in quarters. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> Spin it around. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> One more chop. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> And this is just way too tempting. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> I'm going to have to bite into this. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> I'll tell you how it really tastes. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Look at that. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> I'm going to have to bite into this. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> I'll tell you how it really tastes. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> Look at that. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Oh, it is piping hot. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Ooh, ow, ow. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> That's a good crust. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> Hold this texture soft. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> It's got a good little bite to it. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Ladies and gentlemen, it's official. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> It's a good pizza. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> Going to have to go back for some more. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Well, there we have it. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Our margarita homemade pizza. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> Great for the friends, great for the family, <time_token_95> <time_token_96> and here's the recipe that's following. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> I really hope you enjoyed this video <time_token_96> <time_token_97> and making this pizza as well. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> So, give me some feedback and let me know how it turned out. <time_token_98> <time_token_98> Thanks for watching. <time_token_98> <time_token_98> Please like and subscribe.

Today, I will make in a very classic Vietnamese dish. <time_token_1> <time_token_1> It's a crispy fried spring rolls. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> It's called nim rang or chia yao in Vietnamese. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> The basic filling for nim rang or chia yao is normally ground meat, diced mushrooms and <time_token_3> <time_token_5> julienned or diced vegetables like carrots, hitkama, taro or kohlrabi. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> The filling is wrapped in rice paper and then deep-fried till golden brown. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> The filling is actually not fixed. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> You can change it to whatever kind of vegetables or meats that you want. Normally, we will use minced pork, <time_token_7> <time_token_9> but you can also use minced chicken, turkey or seafood. For vegetarian version, you can also use tofu. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> Just use some paper taro to press it to absorb all the extra moisture and you can mash it with your hands <time_token_10> <time_token_11> to make it look quite like minced meat. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> Sometimes we also use tofu in <time_token_12> <time_token_13> non-vegetarian versions because the tofu can absorb the moisture from the vegetables. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Some vegetables like carrots or hitkama will make the filling more crunchy. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> But the thing is, after a while, the moisture in the vegetables will make the rolls quite soggy. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> So you want to add some other items that can absorb, although moisture like <time_token_17> <time_token_18> mashed sweet potatoes or mung beans. What makes Vietnamese fried spring rolls different from Chinese egg rolls is that <time_token_18> <time_token_20> we use rice paper instead of the wheat flour wrapper. Rice paper is more delicate and it can easily break when you deep fry. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> So there are more techniques and tips to it that you can apply. <time_token_21> <time_token_23> So let's try me in the kitchen today to make the most delicious crispy spring roll that you ever had. Let's begin. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Let's start with the southern starts, crispy spring rolls or jayao. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> You will need 100 grams of shredded taro, 100 grams of shredded carrot, 20 grams of dry woody mushrooms, <time_token_26> <time_token_27> which I have soaked in hot water and cut into thin strips. Some glass noodles which is soaked in hot water <time_token_27> <time_token_27> for 10 minutes. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> Minged garlic and shallot, <time_token_28> <time_token_29> 200 grams of minced pork and 200 grams of minced shrimps. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Shredded taro is more typical for spring rolls from southern Vietnam. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> In a large bowl, combine the minced pork and minced shrimp together and season lightly with salt, sugar and chicken stock, <time_token_32> <time_token_33> about half a teaspoon each. Also add a tablespoon of minced shallot and a tablespoon of minced garlic. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Mix well with your hand in a circular motion like this so the seasonings are well incorporated into the meat. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> Then add all the shredded vegetables, mushrooms and glass noodles. Mix really well. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> To help all the ingredients to stick to each other better, add one egg or just the egg white. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Mix well again and leave to sit for about 15 minutes. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> To soften the rice paper for wrapping, <time_token_42> <time_token_43> I have learned a very useful trick from the chef as hired, which is to moisten the rice paper with a damp cloth <time_token_43> <time_token_44> instead of soaking it in water. <time_token_44> <time_token_46> This makes the rice paper flexible enough to work with but not too wet, so it's easier to deep fry later. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Scoop a heap in tablespoons of the fillings and place nearer to one end. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> Shape it nicely. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> Lift off the end, fold over and then push it backwards, <time_token_48> <time_token_49> just like this. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> This is a trick to distribute the fillings evenly and also have a tight roll. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Then roll until you cross the center of the rice paper. Then fold the bowl sides in <time_token_51> <time_token_52> and continue to roll up until the end. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Ta-da! There you have it. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Very easy, right? <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Heat the generous amount of oil in the pan <time_token_54> <time_token_54> until you see small bubbles appear around the chopsticks. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> Then keep the heat on medium or medium low and start frying. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> The rice paper could be sticky at first, so leave some space in between the rolls. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> After a few minutes, it's okay to bring them closer to each other. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Just fry until they turn golden brown. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> When the spring rolls are nicely golden brown, you can remove them and place on a rack <time_token_64> <time_token_65> or place on paper towel to drain off the excess oil. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> You can serve them just like that at a starter together with some dipping fish sauce and fresh vegetables and herbs. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Mmm, that tastes really good. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> You can also wrap it in a piece of lettuce or rice paper <time_token_68> <time_token_68> together with the fresh herbs and dip in the dipping sauce. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> Now let's make namjang, the northern version of crispy spring roll. You will need 500 grams of minced pork, <time_token_71> <time_token_71> minced wooden mushrooms, <time_token_71> <time_token_72> bean sprouts, and glass noodles, about 1 cup each, <time_token_72> <time_token_73> 1 egg and 1 block of tofu. Combine everything in a large bowl, season with salt, sugar, and pepper, <time_token_73> <time_token_75> and crack in the egg. Namjang is normally wrapped in banh dang name, a super thin piece of rice paper. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> Very dedicated but flexible enough to work with without any water. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Just put the filling closer to one end and roll it up. You don't have to fold the sides inward. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> That's it. Just deep fry and then you will get the northern version <time_token_78> <time_token_78> of Vietnamese spring rolls, namjang. <time_token_79> <time_token_81> Another way to serve these spring rolls is to serve on top of a bowl of rice vermicelli and fresh vegetables and herbs. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Just cut them in bite-side pieces and drizzle the light dipping fish sauce over, mix it up and serve. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> It's also a very nice summer dish. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Now, let's check out what my viewers are cooking this summer. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> Wow, so many great desserts and salads. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Thank you so much for sending in your photos. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> It's so great to share the love for Vietnamese food. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> If you would like your dish to be featured in my future videos, <time_token_89> <time_token_90> next time when you cook a dish with my recipes, <time_token_90> <time_token_91> please upload a photo of your food on Instagram, Facebook, and Google+, with hashtag HelenRecipes. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> I'm so looking forward to seeing your photos. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> I also love to see how you play around with the video functions on Instagram. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> It's so cool.

cook star, and so can you. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> Hi, I'm Remy. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> Today on Cook Time with Remy, we're going to prep and cook a very yummy dish called <time_token_10> <time_token_12> Okay, first things first, the number one rule on Cook Time with Remy is that you always <time_token_12> <time_token_13> check with your parents or an adult before you start cooking. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Next, it's very important to wash your hands before you start cooking. <time_token_14> <time_token_16> Okay, let's get started. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> Today, we're making Colcannon. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> I love eating Colcannon because it tastes great and it's healthy for you. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> The next thing we need to do is get our cooking pots, pans, and bowls. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> We'll also need to have the ingredients to make Colcannon. <time_token_21> <time_token_24> For this dish, you'll need to have cabbage, Yukon Gold potatoes, some green onions, some <time_token_24> <time_token_25> low-fat milk, parsley, and some salt and pepper. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Did you know that cabbage has a natural spicy flavor, which makes it appealing for a lot <time_token_27> <time_token_28> In Scotland, cabbage is called a bokehoe, and in Britain, it's known as a loaf. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> After boiling my potatoes and straining them, I'm going to put them back into the pan to <time_token_32> <time_token_34> And now I'm going to add my milk, and then you want to mash them until they're smooth <time_token_34> <time_token_35> and creamy, which will take me a while. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Now that we've mashed our potatoes, we're bringing a pan of water to boil, and then <time_token_37> <time_token_40> we're going to add some cabbage, then we're going to add some green onions, and some salt <time_token_42> <time_token_43> And then we're going to cover this and let it simmer for about five to seven minutes. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Now we're going to move our potatoes into our mixing bowl, and I like using Yukon Gold <time_token_45> <time_token_47> potatoes because they have a great flavor, they're creamy and buttery, and you really <time_token_47> <time_token_48> don't have to peel them, so that's just another easy thing about this. <time_token_48> <time_token_50> Next, we're going to add our cabbage, because they're about good. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> And now I'm going to use one of my favorite mixing techniques, folding, and it really <time_token_51> <time_token_52> just gets all the flavors there. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Oh wait, I forgot my salt and pepper. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Now we're going to continue folding. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> Now for our presentation, and we are using an ice cream scooper, and it may look like <time_token_57> <time_token_58> ice cream, but it's not, it's much healthier. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Now for our garnish, we have some fresh parsley. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> And there is your beautiful coke ham. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> When you're cooking, it's very important to make sure your ingredients measurement are <time_token_67> <time_token_69> The cooking ingredients you use should always be as fresh as possible, so your food tastes <time_token_69> <time_token_70> Remember the cook time rule, you should always have all five food groups when eating at each <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Cooking is fun, and the food you make should taste good and be healthy for you. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Now for my favorite part, the tasting. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Mmm, that's really good. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Yukon gold potatoes really paid off. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Thanks for hanging out with me on Cook Time with Remy. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> See you next time when we'll be making sweet summer corn succotash. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> All kids should lead a healthy, active, and nutritious life, and we all play a role educating <time_token_82> <time_token_84> young people about healthy choices, including the 16 million children at risk of hunger <time_token_84> <time_token_84> in the U.S. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> Join me and Sodexo to help raise

satsriyaka alaikum welcome back to another session with your <time_token_2> <time_token_4> VahChef at Vahrehvah.com what comes to your mind when I say soup first thing <time_token_4> <time_token_6> you think of is a cold day warm comforting steaming hot tomato see how <time_token_6> <time_token_7> easy it is to land on tomato soup that is because I together with one billion <time_token_7> <time_token_8> other Indians will testify to the fact that tomato soup falls under the <time_token_8> <time_token_10> category of comfort foods it is definitely Indian, Indian national soup <time_token_10> <time_token_11> is supposed to be Mulga Tani soup that is odd isn't it? if you travel in the famous <time_token_11> <time_token_13> Indian dry ways and want soup you get tomato if you walk into any hotel and <time_token_13> <time_token_14> see soup section on the menu you may not actually find Mulga Tani but I'm willing <time_token_14> <time_token_15> to get hundred bucks that you will see tomato so to make this tomato soup just <time_token_15> <time_token_17> heat some butter in a pan add little bit cumin seeds because I love to add a <time_token_17> <time_token_19> little cumin just add little bit cumin seeds, add little chopped garlic <time_token_19> <time_token_22> okay add some chopped onion very little for three tomatoes are used half a small <time_token_22> <time_token_23> onion you can add any vegetables you want to this so I love to use celery in <time_token_23> <time_token_25> my soup because celery gives a very nice flavor you can add leeks you can <time_token_25> <time_token_26> add carrots you can add any vegetables you want and one more vegetable I love <time_token_26> <time_token_27> in tomato soup is bell pepper there is a green pepper or we call it capsicum in <time_token_27> <time_token_29> India so use little bit so what this does is it gives a very nice flavor to <time_token_29> <time_token_31> your tomato soup after you saute this for a moment add chopped tomatoes add little salt <time_token_31> <time_token_33> the one herb that goes excellent with your tomato soup is basil if you have basil <time_token_33> <time_token_35> just add you know I don't have basil so you know what actually I think I have <time_token_35> <time_token_38> okay okay I have this basil herb I just bought it recently so it is hanging out <time_token_38> <time_token_40> there so we're going to use some of this basil ah if you add basil immediately a <time_token_40> <time_token_41> very nice flavor comes I don't know how but somehow I'll find my ingredients <time_token_41> <time_token_45> from somewhere or rather so I had some pepper so after you have cooked this <time_token_45> <time_token_46> tomato puree what you do is transfer it into a blender <time_token_46> <time_token_50> for a soup you need some kind of thickening so what we're going to do <time_token_50> <time_token_51> we're going to make some roux we're going to make some blonde roux blonde roux is <time_token_51> <time_token_52> slightly golden in color so what I'm going to do I'm add I'm going to add <time_token_52> <time_token_54> some maida around one teaspoon maybe little less than one teaspoon of maida <time_token_54> <time_token_56> what I did I added one tablespoon of all-purpose flour to my butter and on a <time_token_56> <time_token_56> slow flame I'm going to cook along with the butter <time_token_56> <time_token_58> ok the roux is slightly brown see I have taken this tomato puree what I made I <time_token_58> <time_token_59> strained it and I'm going to add little by little first add very little and then <time_token_59> <time_token_61> add slowly see if you add everything at one time this is going to form lumps <time_token_61> <time_token_64> once it gets lightly dissolved then add the entire amount yeah let us simmer this <time_token_64> <time_token_66> for like 10 minutes then we will check salt and seasoning oh yeah you know while <time_token_66> <time_token_68> blending I added very little red color because to get this nice tomato kind of <time_token_68> <time_token_69> consistency and I love to add little bit of sugar in my tomato soup that gives a <time_token_69> <time_token_71> very nice taste to the soup adding cream is optional but I love to add so I'm <time_token_71> <time_token_74> going to add little bit of cream to my tomato soup look at this the whole studio <time_token_74> <time_token_76> is smelling nice tomato soup with nice basil from my herb section by the way <time_token_76> <time_token_77> many toppings can also be used such as sour cream shredded cheese crackers or <time_token_77> <time_token_79> salsa but with kids around the world believe me I don't know what the <time_token_79> <time_token_80> fascination is with little kids maybe all the kids like to see the brown <time_token_80> <time_token_81> floating things and if you ever wonder what those brown floating things on the <time_token_81> <time_token_83> top of tomato soup don't fear you can even make that at home if you stick with <time_token_83> <time_token_84> my show maybe you will even learn how to manufacture a husband at home that <time_token_84> <time_token_85> learns to cook so coming back to those little brown things they are called <time_token_85> <time_token_86> croutons they're nothing but neat squares of bread that are deep fried and they <time_token_86> <time_token_88> turn crispy golden brown when they float and slowly soak on the tomato soup they <time_token_88> <time_token_89> make you a hero in front of your kids when I started the show I didn't <time_token_89> <time_token_90> realize that I didn't have croutons but I had bread so what I did I simply fried <time_token_90> <time_token_92> my breads and now I have them on my tomato soup those little brown things <time_token_92> <time_token_94> floating I hope you enjoyed today's session of learning to

will show you how to cook shrimp tempura <time_token_6> <time_token_10> pinoy style. So here are our main ingredients. Clean prawn, alinista pushia, egg, breadcrumbs, <time_token_11> <time_token_15> baking soda, salt, ground black pepper, all-purpose flour, and we have here ice water. So this <time_token_15> <time_token_18> is so easy. We will combine all of the ingredients to the bowl and then we will proceed. I will show <time_token_18> <time_token_18> you the next step. <time_token_18> <time_token_22> Now we will combine all of the ingredients to the bowl. First, alinina or flour, salt, <time_token_22> <time_token_32> put a little bit of egg, baking soda, salt, black pepper, 3 spoons of alinista, ice cold <time_token_32> <time_token_37> water, conti conti lumpo. If you want, you know, if you want your tempura is spicy, you can add <time_token_37> <time_token_43> some chili powder. Again, you know why we are using ice cold water? It will give crispiness to the <time_token_43> <time_token_47> shrimp. Dip it deep to the breadcrumbs. Okay, we are going to mix the prawn in with the <time_token_47> <time_token_52> mixture of the bowl. Dip the prawn in the breadcrumbs, but make sure your prawn is dry also.

Okay, let's start our <time_token_59> <time_token_65> shrimp tempura. So I breaded all of the shrimp. So just leave the tail on and then this is ready to fry. Just fry maximum 4 <time_token_65> <time_token_67> pieces so that you can monitor, you know. Once you drop it all, maybe some of the shrimp will be burned. <time_token_73> <time_token_78> And make sure the medium heat is not boiling. See, that's a nice tempura. And then, <time_token_78> <time_token_82> you transfer this to a plate with a paper towel so that it will absorb the oil. See, this is cooked. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> Again, we will proceed to the next step. Okay then, our shrimp tempura is ready. These <time_token_85> <time_token_89> are so delicious.

For this pasta salad I'm <time_token_12> <time_token_13> actually using orecchiette, which is this adorable round pasta that's sort of <time_token_13> <time_token_14> shaped like a seashell, and all I'm going to do is cook my pasta according to <time_token_14> <time_token_16> package directions. I'm using an induction range which is really handy <time_token_16> <time_token_17> because it actually boils water in under two minutes. Let me tell you that can go <time_token_17> <time_token_18> a long way when you're cooking pasta. Once my pasta is cooked through I'm going <time_token_18> <time_token_19> to drain it in a colander and then run it under some cold water to stop the <time_token_19> <time_token_21> cooking process. Next it's time to mix up a really simple sauce for this pasta <time_token_21> <time_token_22> salad, and it's really just a matter of mixing some pesto with some balsamic <time_token_22> <time_token_23> vinegar. All I'm going to do is whisk the two together and what you end up with <time_token_23> <time_token_25> is this sweet and savory sauce that has a ton of flavor. I'm going to pour this <time_token_25> <time_token_26> sauce over my pasta and give it a good toss until it's evenly coated. Then I'm <time_token_26> <time_token_27> going to add some more beautiful caprese flavor with some cherry tomatoes that <time_token_27> <time_token_28> I've just cut in half, some mini mozzarella balls, and some freshly <time_token_28> <time_token_30> chopped basil. I'm going to give it all one more toss and this pasta salad is <time_token_30> <time_token_31> ready to enjoy. This fresh gorgeous salad boasts so many yummy flavors of <time_token_31> <time_token_33> summer, but for me the basil really is the star of this show. It can be enjoyed <time_token_33> <time_token_35> right away or stored in the refrigerator for between three and four days. Next up <time_token_35> <time_token_37> I've got my amazing BLT pasta salad with a delicious homemade Italian dressing. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> Now for this recipe I'm actually using farfale, which are these adorable little <time_token_38> <time_token_40> bowties, which I think really add a sense of occasion to this pasta salad. For the <time_token_40> <time_token_41> B in this BLT pasta salad we are going to fire up some bacon in a skillet on <time_token_41> <time_token_42> the stove. I've got four or five slices of bacon over medium heat. I'm going to <time_token_42> <time_token_43> cook it until it's nice and crispy and golden brown. Then I'm just going to <time_token_43> <time_token_45> remove it from the skillet and drain it on some paper towels. Next it's time to <time_token_45> <time_token_46> get to work on my yummy Italian dressing. It all starts with some olive <time_token_46> <time_token_47> oil in a bowl. To that I'm going to add some red wine vinegar, some fresh lemon <time_token_47> <time_token_49> juice, and some minced garlic. Next I've got some dried herbs. I've got some dried <time_token_49> <time_token_50> parsley, some dried basil, and some dried oregano. I'm going to season this up with <time_token_50> <time_token_52> some salt and some pepper and then give it a good whisk. Now because this <time_token_52> <time_token_53> dressing comes together so easily I like to make a big batch and then store <time_token_53> <time_token_54> it in my refrigerator for up to five days. My fridge has all these handy <time_token_54> <time_token_55> adjustable bins and shelves that make it easy to make space for tall bottles like <time_token_55> <time_token_57> this. This dressing is amazing on salads but it also makes an awesome marinade or <time_token_57> <time_token_58> a dip for yummy crusty bread. Now it's time to bring it all together. So I've <time_token_58> <time_token_60> got my cooked farfale in a large mixing bowl and to that I'm going to add some <time_token_60> <time_token_61> chopped romaine lettuce, some chopped cherry tomatoes, and my tasty cooked <time_token_61> <time_token_63> bacon. I'm also adding some finely diced red onion for a little bit of sweetness <time_token_63> <time_token_64> and added crunch. I'm going to mix it all together but I'm going to leave my <time_token_64> <time_token_65> dressing on the side because this salad is best dressed 10 minutes before <time_token_65> <time_token_66> serving. This salad is sure to be a hit with your guests. It's got all of the <time_token_66> <time_token_68> wonderful flavors of a classic BLT and a ton of great crunch. Finally today I'm <time_token_68> <time_token_70> going to show you my incredibly fresh summer veggie pasta salad. For this <time_token_70> <time_token_71> recipe I am using all sorts of gorgeous summer vegetables like green beans, red <time_token_71> <time_token_72> bell peppers, and zucchini that I got from my local farmers market. But it's <time_token_72> <time_token_74> also so versatile you can really use any kind of fresh veggies you like. I like to <time_token_74> <time_token_75> store these in my humidity controlled crisper drawer so they stay super fresh <time_token_75> <time_token_76> and retain all that crunch. In a steamer basket I'm going to gently steam my <time_token_76> <time_token_78> green beans until they're tender crisp. Then I'm going to get to work on my <time_token_78> <time_token_79> dressing. This dressing is really really simple. It's basically just a matter of <time_token_79> <time_token_81> mixing some olive oil with some white wine vinegar, a little bit of Dijon <time_token_81> <time_token_82> mustard, and some salt and pepper and whisking that all together. Next I'm <time_token_82> <time_token_83> going to assemble my salad. So I've got my cooked rotini in a bowl and to that <time_token_83> <time_token_85> I'm going to add my gently steamed green beans, some red bell pepper, and some <time_token_85> <time_token_86> chopped zucchini. For some sweetness I'm adding some fresh corn that I've <time_token_86> <time_token_87> actually cut right off of the cob. No cooking required. I'm going to finish <time_token_87> <time_token_89> this off with some finely chopped red onion and some fresh parsley. Then I'm <time_token_89> <time_token_90> going to pour over my dressing and toss it all until it's well combined. This <time_token_90> <time_token_91> delicious salad can be stored in your refrigerator for three or four days and <time_token_91> <time_token_92> really just gets better the longer it sits in that dressing. I hope these three <time_token_92> <time_token_93> tasty recipes help to inspire your summer entertaining and of course if <time_token_93> <time_token_95> you give them a try be sure to tweet or Instagram me a photo because you know I <time_token_95> <time_token_96> love seeing your kitchen creations.

com and today we're making a holiday classic, <time_token_4> <time_token_5> the Waldorf salad. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> And I'm actually going to make a chicken Waldorf salad because this is something I plan to <time_token_6> <time_token_7> have for dinner tonight so I wanted to add a little bit more umph to it. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> But this is a good one to make for your holiday table for that big dinner or to actually make <time_token_8> <time_token_9> for a brunch because it really hits all those notes. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> It hits the sweet, the savory, it's crunchy and it's super easy. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> The only thing we're going to be using the oven for is to toast up some walnuts. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> So let's get started. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> So right now I'm just going to be prepping my vegetables and my fruit. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> I just have some grapes right here, some red seedless grapes that I'm just going to cut <time_token_15> <time_token_16> And as I'm going I'm just tossing them into my salad bowl. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Now I'm chopping up some celery. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Now I'm just going to dice up some apples. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Now that I have my apple in the bowl I'm going to go ahead and squeeze some lemon over it <time_token_22> <time_token_23> and this is just going to prevent it from browning. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> I'm also chopping up some dried cranberries to toss in the salad and this is just going <time_token_26> <time_token_27> to add a nice sweetness and also a tangy sourness. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> I have a skillet set at about medium heat and I'm just going to toss in some walnuts <time_token_30> <time_token_30> and get them toasted up. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Basically when you start smelling them that's when they're done. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> You want to keep a close eye on them because you don't want them to burn. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> Alright I'm going to see if I can flip them like all those professional chefs do. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> Hopefully they don't all end up on the floor. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> Alright that was close. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> I'm going to give myself a couple of points for that. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> Okay I think they're done. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> I'm going to take them off the heat. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Alright here's our toasted walnuts. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> I'm just going to give them a rough chop. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> I'm not going to toss them in the salad right away because I want them to get soggy but <time_token_41> <time_token_42> I do just want to get them chopped and out of the way. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Alright now on to the dressing. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> Right now in my measuring cup I have some Greek yogurt and I'm going to put in some <time_token_45> <time_token_48> light mayonnaise and mix this together. <time_token_48> <time_token_50> I'm going to add some agave nectar and give this another mix. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> I'm also going to put in a little bit of cracked black pepper. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Give this another little mix around. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> Give it a taste. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> This is good. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> Alright let's start assembling our salad. <time_token_60> <time_token_68> In goes the chicken and I'm going to put a couple of dollops of this dressing on. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> And mix this around. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> I want to get all the flavors incorporated. <time_token_76> <time_token_79> This is so good guys. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> It's sweet, it's savory, it's crunchy, it's tangy. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> I'm so glad we didn't go overboard on the dressing because you can definitely taste <time_token_81> <time_token_83> the individual ingredients that we have in here perfectly. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> This is so good. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> And then look at those colors. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> You've got the red from the grapes, the red from the cranberries, green. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> It's like the perfect holiday salad. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> So if this is something that's familiar to your holiday table go ahead and give this <time_token_90> <time_token_91> version a try. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> I guarantee your family is not going to even notice the difference. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> And if you haven't

I'm telling you, if you try this recipe it's really good <time_token_4> <time_token_5> and I'm going to show you how to put it together. We'll first start out by showing you what <time_token_5> <time_token_7> ingredients actually go into this lamb kebab recipe. These are very simple. We've got a green <time_token_7> <time_token_11> pepper. We've got two ripe tomatoes, medium onion, a lemon, some bamboo, shish kebab sticks, <time_token_12> <time_token_14> some lamb we're going to cut up into cubes. You could use leg of lamb or your lamb shank. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> I've got a teaspoon of cinnamon, a tablespoon of minced garlic, black pepper, <time_token_18> <time_token_20> sea salt, and some Worcestershire sauce. Remember I'm going to prep all this up <time_token_20> <time_token_21> and we'll show you how to put this together and then take it out in the grill and show you how to <time_token_21> <time_token_23> cook. The next step here is because you can see we have all of our ingredients cut up. We've got <time_token_23> <time_token_27> our lamb here. We're going to season this lamb with about 10 rotations of cracked black <time_token_27> <time_token_29> pepper and then we're going to put in about a teaspoon and a half of sea salt, <time_token_29> <time_token_35> a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and our garlic, and our cinnamon. And then what we're going to do <time_token_36> <time_token_37> we're just going to mix that up thoroughly. Let's make some marination. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> For the purposes of this video I would normally set this in the refrigerator and let this marinate <time_token_40> <time_token_43> for about an hour before I started putting these kebab together. But since we're going to do this <time_token_43> <time_token_46> quickly we just start taking these bamboo skewers and I just start skewering these pieces of lamb, <time_token_46> <time_token_49> lemon, green pepper, onion, <time_token_54> <time_token_55> back to the lamb, <time_token_56> <time_token_58> back to some lemon. When this lemon cooks it caramelizes and some of the <time_token_58> <time_token_60> shear comes out and it really does something special to the lamb. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> What I'll do is just make up a series of about six of these guys here. <time_token_66> <time_token_69> All right, now that we've got our grill preheated to medium, <time_token_69> <time_token_71> we can just start putting our shish kebabs right on the grill here. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Six of them. <time_token_74> <time_token_78> What these do is cook for about maybe four minutes per side and it's the last little thing <time_token_78> <time_token_80> here I usually do is just drizzle a little olive oil on there. So what we're going to do is let <time_token_80> <time_token_82> these little guys go here for a minute and we'll come back and flip them off and take a look at <time_token_82> <time_token_85> them. All right, all right, we just flip these lamb kebabs over and we're going to go for another <time_token_85> <time_token_87> four minutes and we'll get ready to plate them up and see how they look. <time_token_88> <time_token_90> It's Glen the Bull Chef. We've just put together the fabulous dish of lamb kebabs with the lemon <time_token_90> <time_token_92> cinnamon. That's really quite spectacular. We're going to just take one little piece off here, <time_token_92> <time_token_95> give it a sample.

<time_token_2> <time_token_2> It's because I'm scared. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> I don't have a lot of experience with it. <time_token_3> <time_token_3> I love to eat it, but I thought I would give this one of my favorites to try this very <time_token_3> <time_token_4> spicy lamb type curry dish. <time_token_4> <time_token_4> So I hope I got it close. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> You Indian cuisine experts will be the judge. <time_token_5> <time_token_5> So here we go. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> So step one here, I'm going to put four lamb shanks in a plastic bag. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> You need to get marinated overnight before we start the dish. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> So I'm going to place those in, and then into a bowl, I'm going to pour some cider vinegar, <time_token_8> <time_token_10> some vegetable oil, some salt, and then something called tamarind. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> I'm using a tamarind concentrate, and we'll talk a little bit about that on the blog, <time_token_11> <time_token_12> but it's a very tart, sour, kind of citrus-like ingredient. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> I started mixing that up, and then I realized I never put the garam masala in, which is <time_token_13> <time_token_14> a blend of Indian spices. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> We've used that before. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> We like it. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> So I'm going to mix that in, and that's basically the marinade. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> So we're going to pour that over the lamb shanks. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> We're going to seal up that bag really well. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Just to confuse you, I put mine in a second bag because I thought I had a leak. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> We're going to squeeze out as much air as possible so the meat is immersed in the marinade, <time_token_18> <time_token_19> and then we're going to put that in the fridge overnight. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> Not a bad idea to turn it over once in a while. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> The next day, I'm going to pull it out of the bag. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> I'm going to place it on an oiled foil-lined sheet pan. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Don't throw away the marinade, by the way. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> That's going in the stew later. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> So just reserve the marinade. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> I'm going to salt those generously on both sides, and we're going to brown those in a <time_token_23> <time_token_25> very hot oven for 50, for 15 or 20 minutes, until they're nice and brown. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> We're going to pull those out and reserve them until needed. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> Next up, in a blender, we're going to add a lot of garlic, a lot of ginger, some cherry <time_token_27> <time_token_28> tomatoes, a nice big onion, and a little bit of water. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> We're going to pulse that on and off until we have a nice, smooth puree. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> It kind of looks like a delicious strawberry smoothie, and yet it's so the opposite of <time_token_31> <time_token_32> So just set that aside, and it's back over to the stove, where we're going to start the <time_token_32> <time_token_34> We're going to put a heavy Dutch oven on medium-high heat, and I'm going to put in some clarified <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Now, this is supposed to be something called ghee, which is basically a clarified butter, <time_token_35> <time_token_35> but clarified butter will work. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> So I'm going to put my butter in. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> I'm going to throw a roughly chopped onion in there, with a big pinch of salt, and we're <time_token_37> <time_token_37> going to brown this. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> And I'm not talking golden brown, I'm talking almost golden black. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> That's going to add sweetness and a depth of color to the sauce. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> So just keep cooking them, and right there you're thinking, that's probably good. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Let them go further, okay? <time_token_41> <time_token_42> While those are browning, I'm going to get my spice blend together, which is cumin, cinnamon, <time_token_43> <time_token_45> black pepper, cayenne, and a lot of it, dry mustard, and paprika, okay? <time_token_45> <time_token_45> And all that will be on the blog, of course. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> We're going to go back over the stove, check the onions, and now we're talking. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> That's what we want. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> Nicely browned, very dark edges, perfect. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> And at that point, we're going to back the heat down to medium and dump in the spices, <time_token_49> <time_token_49> and we're going to kind of toast the spices in that hot butter. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> And that really wakes up the flavor, and it really, really adds an extra dimension, which <time_token_51> <time_token_51> I guess would be the fifth dimension. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> But who's keeping track? <time_token_52> <time_token_53> And it only needs to cook for about two minutes, but it really does make a difference. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> After that, we're going to go ahead and dump in the marinade that was left over from the <time_token_54> <time_token_54> bag of lamb. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Remember, that was the cider, and the tamarind, and the oil. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> So I'm going to dump that in, and then we're going to dump in the mixture from the blender, <time_token_56> <time_token_57> the onion, the tomato, the ginger, the garlic. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> We're going to give that a stir. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> We're going to raise the heat up to high. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> We want to bring this up to a simmer. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> And before we put the lamb back in, we're going to go ahead and add a little bit of brown sugar, <time_token_59> <time_token_60> all right, just to balance out that acidity and heat. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> So stir that in, and then we can place our lamb back in. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> And if you're using a similar size pot, you should have enough liquid to just almost come <time_token_63> <time_token_63> up to the top. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> It doesn't have to be totally covered. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> This is going to stew for three hours, and we're going to turn these several times. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> So as long as you have that much liquid, you're okay. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> If you need to add another splash of water, don't be afraid. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> Don't forget, you can always reduce sauces later. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> So once the lamb goes in, I want you to turn the heat down too low. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> I want you to cover it tightly, and I want you to simmer that very slowly on very low <time_token_69> <time_token_70> heat for about three hours. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Not a bad idea to turn it over once in a while, and all you're trying to do, and why there's <time_token_71> <time_token_72> no way to screw up the cooking part of this, you're just going to simmer it until the meat's <time_token_73> <time_token_73> See how that fork goes right into that meat? <time_token_74> <time_token_74> So like I said, it's going to take about three hours, but don't quote me on it. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> It could take two and a half, could take four. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> At that point, I'm going to go ahead and remove the lamb from the pot. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> You can just cover it with foil while we finish the sauce. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> And finishing the sauce means two things. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> The old skimming season. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> So we're going to turn the heat up a little bit. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> We want to bring this back to a simmer, and we need to skim off all that fat. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> There's a ton of it. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Just take your ladle and skim all the fat off before you serve it. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> And besides defatifying the top, the other thing you should do is taste for seasoning. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Although I highly doubt you're going to have to do much adjusting, but you know what? <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Check just in case. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Maybe add a little salt. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> And that's it. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Go ahead and throw your lamb shank on a plate. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> I'm serving mine next to some lentils and rice. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> I'm going to spoon over that incredible sauce. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> I'm going to garnish with some whole cilantro leaves. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> And there you go. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> Authenticity notwithstanding, this was a super delicious, incredibly tasty, very spicy, exciting <time_token_89> <time_token_89> Really fork tender. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Should just fall right off the bone in just a very complex flavor. <time_token_90> <time_token_92> Spicy, sweet, sour, aromatic, and that beautiful, subtly gamey lamb. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Just the absolute perfect meat for this. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> So I really, really hope you give this a try. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> Head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts and more info as usual. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> And as always, enjoy.

<time_token_1> <time_token_3> And one of my favourite dishes has to be a pad thai, one of those beautiful noodle dishes <time_token_3> <time_token_4> bursting with aromatic flavours and it's one of those classic thai dishes that has just <time_token_4> <time_token_5> become worldwide famous. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> So I'm going to show you how to make it, it is so snappy so quick, three garlic cloves <time_token_6> <time_token_7> go into a pestle and mortar, we're going to chop up a chilli, if you want to take out <time_token_7> <time_token_9> the seeds do but I like it with lots of spice so get your one red chilli in there and talking <time_token_9> <time_token_10> of that coriander, come over here, come over here and have a look, because in the base <time_token_10> <time_token_11> here do you see all those little coriander roots? <time_token_11> <time_token_12> You want to use them because they're so full of flavour, a lot of people throw them away. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> See all those? <time_token_13> <time_token_13> Full of flavour. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Give them a good smell, they are the most aromatic beautiful smell you will ever get <time_token_14> <time_token_16> so rip up some of that and now I'm going to use the juice and the zest of two lime the <time_token_16> <time_token_18> minute you start grating this on your little microplane grater, the smell is so so fragrant <time_token_18> <time_token_19> it's kind of like summer mojitos, I love that smell. <time_token_19> <time_token_22> Right loads of lime zest, bash it, bash the bejesus out of it, okay look in here, this <time_token_22> <time_token_23> is where the magic's at, if you want a good pad thai you have got to get this paste right <time_token_23> <time_token_25> so get this right and you are on to our winner, right so get that wok nice and hot, get some <time_token_25> <time_token_27> sunflower oil in here and just a good tablespoon or so and you want it to be smoking, don't <time_token_27> <time_token_28> be afraid of the sizzle factor okay, you want to swirl that around the sides like this <time_token_28> <time_token_29> and then get that beautiful paste straight in there, it's going to fizz, it's going to <time_token_29> <time_token_31> buzz, it's going to do all those wonderful things, it's going to spit and you just need <time_token_31> <time_token_33> to stand back okay, spread it around the base of the pan, let that aromatic flavour erupt <time_token_33> <time_token_34> during the kitchen and what you will get is that wonderful waft of smell up your nose <time_token_34> <time_token_36> and my fire alarm is probably going to go off but we'll stick with it okay, as soon <time_token_36> <time_token_37> as it starts to become aromatic get your rest of your ingredients in there, we've got <time_token_37> <time_token_39> some prawns, they're going to fry off, we've got some bean sprouts and we've got a good <time_token_39> <time_token_41> handful of those spring onions going in here as well, give it a mix through and on top <time_token_41> <time_token_42> of that we've got some lovely noodles, lovely rice noodles, really important that you get <time_token_42> <time_token_44> rice noodles here, they're kind of the authentic ones you need to get, in with your lime juice <time_token_44> <time_token_45> straight in with the juice of two limes, in with some brown sugar, really important <time_token_45> <time_token_47> with these Asian dishes that you get that sweetness, that saltiness, the sourness and <time_token_47> <time_token_49> with a, sorry the chilli is hitting the back of my throat, with that saltiness we're going <time_token_49> <time_token_50> to get some

The taste, the flavor, it's dramatically different. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> Really yes. Now what happens with this cabbage? Now this goes into. Okay okay <time_token_43> <time_token_45> here's the onions browned off. Cabbage goes in there yes. So could you use <time_token_45> <time_token_46> sauerkraut or would you like to the fresh cabbage? I like to use a fresh or you <time_token_46> <time_token_48> could use Swiss chard or whatever any kind of greens you have. And tomatoes too? Yeah. <time_token_48> <time_token_50> Okay. And we'd use fresh tomatoes in season or you know. And a whole beer? Yeah. <time_token_50> <time_token_52> Part of a beer. Beer the whole thing. Oh darn I was gonna I was hoping that you <time_token_52> <time_token_53> would say I could have a little swing. Yes you can. Yes you can. I just want one <time_token_53> <time_token_54> little taste. This is the fun part of cooking with beer. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> There's some salt, some pepper. Yes. Fabulous. So are you always cooking on <time_token_58> <time_token_60> the ranch? Yeah. And tell everybody where the ranch is. This is a beautiful place. Well it's really a farm I guess you know but we're <time_token_60> <time_token_62> north-central Iowa. Our Niman Ranch world headquarters is on the farm. I grew <time_token_62> <time_token_64> up on this farm. And look at that. And then here's the end product. Now did mom <time_token_64> <time_token_65> teach you how to make this? You know what we just kind of made this up one day <time_token_65> <time_token_66> when we needed something quick. And you make the cornbread too. Out of corn raised <time_token_66> <time_token_68> on the pastures on which the pigs graze the year before right? That's right. So <time_token_68> <time_token_69> they're fertilizing the fields. Right. And the corn did it grow really <time_token_69> <time_token_70> beautifully? Corn grows great. We have really a high quality corn field right there. The corn <time_token_70> <time_token_72> fields kind of in the background. With a fence around it I hope. Well there's <time_token_72> <time_token_73> electric fence. Oh okay. The pigs were there last year so the corn on our farm <time_token_73> <time_token_75> and the hog pasture are part of a rotation. We raise corn, soybeans, oats, hay <time_token_75> <time_token_77> and then pigs again. And so I ground this on Monday this corn meal. Oh you did? And <time_token_77> <time_token_79> brought it in today. Oh here cut me a piece. So this looks so good. This is a great <time_token_79> <time_token_81> Saturday lunch. It's a great cold night supper isn't it? It's pretty much it's <time_token_81> <time_token_82> pretty good anytime. And if you're a farmhand on a on an appropriate farm this <time_token_82> <time_token_83> is the kind of food you're going I guess you'd have to have two sausages right if <time_token_83> <time_token_85> you're a farmhand? Well you're gonna be pretty hungry. You want a big piece or a <time_token_85> <time_token_87> small piece. Oh whatever. That looks good. I want to taste that freshly ground corn <time_token_87> <time_token_89> meal. So what kind of corn is that? It's just yellow actually yellow field corn. <time_token_89> <time_token_92> It is really tasty. Paul thank you very much and thank you for raising animals to me and talking about it. <time_token_92> <time_token_94> It's great. Well thanks for having myself and my daughter. You'll be right back.

"asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_1> Hello friends, welcome to my home kitchen, I am Bona and today I am going to show you <time_token_1> <time_token_2> one of the Chinese or Thai whatever you call it and it is a vegetable spring rolls. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> So let's start. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> These healthy spring rolls are light and refreshing with an exotic flavor. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> They make a wonderful easy appetizer or side dish to complement an Asian meal. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> I can also tell this a Vietnam vegetarian spring rolls. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> So let's first talk about the ingredients. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> So the first thing I am going to show you, this is the spring roll pastry. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> Easily available at Indian Chinese Thai Vietnam stores this way. <time_token_9> <time_token_9> From this pastry actually you can make samosa as well and made of cheese. <time_token_9> <time_token_11> These pastries I am going to wrap it into the dough wet rolls to prevent them getting <time_token_12> <time_token_13> And now I have these vegetables, all the vegetables I cut into the lengthwise and this is the <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Green onion and the yellow onion, other vegetables such as cabbage, carrots, bell peppers, any <time_token_15> <time_token_16> vegetable that you like you can add or omit. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> And I have these rice noodles and it's a very crystal. <time_token_17> <time_token_19> And so that I am going to put into the boiling water so they get a little bit of tender and <time_token_19> <time_token_19> we can cut it. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> You just have to keep 30 seconds or a minute or so and you will get them. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Get all the noodles soaked into the water and again take them out of the water after <time_token_21> <time_token_22> We want to keep this noodle crispy, we don't want to really boil it. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> Oops mine got a little bit more tender so I won't be able to cut them so I am just going <time_token_23> <time_token_23> to drain out the water. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> Just use warm water I guess to just make them tender. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> Now I am going to prepare the spice mixture so for that I am going to take the soy sauce. <time_token_28> <time_token_31> I am going to add the garlic, ginger, sesame seeds, and this is the red fresh pepper. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> And just a little bit of salt. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Combine everything and now we are ready to saute our vegetables. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> I have the wok heated and I am going to add about 1 tablespoon of olive oil only. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> We don't need much oil. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> To these add the spices mixture that we prepared. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Add the onions, green onion or the scallion and the yellow onion, everything into the <time_token_41> <time_token_41> Give it a stir, let the onion cook a little bit. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> Keep the stove on a medium high. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> Now one by one add everything, I am going to add the rice noodles and the green sprouts. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Make sure to separate out the noodles, you can use the fork if you need to. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> But if you do it right way as I said that you don't need to boil actually, you can just <time_token_47> <time_token_48> make it tender and cut it so that way it will still be crispy and not like mine. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> And now I am going to add my other rest of the vegetables. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> It looks great now isn't it, all the colorful vegetables. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Combine everything well now. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> We don't want to overcook our vegetables just to saute everything, all the vegetables. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> So our spring roll filling is ready. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Now it's time to fill the spring rolls. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> So I have this all purpose flour like almost two tablespoons only and to that I am going <time_token_57> <time_token_57> to add the water. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> And make the paste. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> And I am going to pop this into the microwave for almost 10-15 seconds only. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> So our all purpose paste is ready and this will actually help us to seal the edges of <time_token_62> <time_token_62> the spring roll. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> You can simply. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Now I am going to take one pastry at a time and we just put this into the diamond shape. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Take about three to four tablespoons of plain. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> So the first thing you want to do is take the end and tuck inside and then keep rolling. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> And when you come into the middle take both sides in and wrap. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> And again start rolling and roll till half and again and you are going to use the paste <time_token_71> <time_token_72> that we made to seal the edge. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> So it sticks well and so spring roll is ready. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> I am going to make rest of the spring rolls and then we will be frying. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> I am done with my all spring rolls. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> So we have this ready and it's ready to fry so we are going to fry now. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> I had the oil preheating and it's ready now. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Turn on the other side when one side is done. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> Look at it. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> The one side is done golden brown looks nice and these are the crispiest spring rolls. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> Spring rolls are done and ready to take out. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> Use a paper towel to drain out the excess oil. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> And I am going to fry the rest of the spring rolls. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> Look at them. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> They look so good. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> And now it's time for the presentation. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> I have this sauce, it's a Chinese sauce. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> And I kept some of the cabbage leaves that I am going to put up here. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> And now place the spring rolls onto the cabbage leaves. <time_token_91> <time_token_93> Put all of these spring rolls in on the side. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> This is the zenithin sauce. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Just going to give it a taste. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> It already looks so crunchy. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> It's very crispy, crunchy, delicious. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> So thank you for watching.

I am going to make today Thai Fry Rice. You have already <time_token_4> <time_token_5> learnt Chinese Fry Rice. Here the main taste is of the green curry. Thai cooking has got <time_token_5> <time_token_7> three types of curries, red curry, green curry and yellow curry. These three things <time_token_7> <time_token_8> are there. Here we are going to make use of green curry. So I am going to show you how <time_token_8> <time_token_9> to make the green curry. Then we make the rice. It's very easy, very simple and tasty. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> So we start making the green curry paste. Here the main taste comes from the lemon grass. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> You get in the market, see them and you have to take the roots of it. Well, if you don't <time_token_15> <time_token_17> get the roots sometimes, they are difficult to get in the market. So you use whatever <time_token_17> <time_token_18> the thick part is available. Otherwise, cut the grass very finely and then boil it for <time_token_18> <time_token_20> a while. So it becomes soft and grinded. Then add to the paste. That's the only way <time_token_20> <time_token_21> you can use it, the lemon grass. The main taste is here, is a really good fresh coriander. <time_token_21> <time_token_24> Add a few chopped onions, very few. Garlic, green chillies, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, <time_token_24> <time_token_26> black pepper powder, little bit. A piece of ginger, salt. To maintain the green colour, <time_token_26> <time_token_28> add lemon juice and the lemon peel. There are lots of things we have not used here because <time_token_28> <time_token_29> they are not easily available in the market. So we have done what is easily available here <time_token_29> <time_token_31> in the market. Now you have seen what I have added, right? So this mixture we add lot of <time_token_31> <time_token_32> water and grind it very, very finely. That is very important. This is our lovely green <time_token_32> <time_token_33> curry paste. This is very important. You must grind it very finely and this is quite a lot. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> You can store it in your fridge and use it wherever you want it. So let's start making <time_token_35> <time_token_36> the Thai fried rice. You all of you know very well, the rice has to be cold. It has to be <time_token_36> <time_token_37> separate. See? It's really important here. If the rice is hot, the curry is not going <time_token_37> <time_token_39> to come out well. In Thai or Chinese cooking, the rice has to be nice and 99% cooked. That's <time_token_39> <time_token_41> what you have to remember. Well, let's start doing it. So heat the oil. Fried chopped onions. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> Well, you can use plain onions or spring onions. But spring onions give them better taste. <time_token_43> <time_token_46> So whatever is available with you, you use it. Now I have added baby corn. This is parboil <time_token_46> <time_token_48> and a few capsicum. We are going to add a few spring onion leaves in the beginning and <time_token_48> <time_token_50> later also. It gives a little colourful. Nice colour. So we are going to add a few green <time_token_50> <time_token_53> chillies also. Add the curry paste around 2 tbsp. It's to your liking. 2 tbsp. Ok? So <time_token_53> <time_token_58> try it again. Don't try too much. Now I am going to add the cooked rice. Salt. Little <time_token_58> <time_token_62> pepper. It has got light green colour. Here the soy sauce is little often. You can add <time_token_62> <time_token_63> very little soy sauce. You know why I am talking like this. In the market, many varieties of <time_token_63> <time_token_64> soy sauce are available. Some are very dark in colour. Some are very light in colour. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> So if it is dark in colour, use less. If it is light soy sauce, then use more. It depends <time_token_66> <time_token_68> on the quality of soy sauce available in the market. So now our rice is ready. So our green <time_token_68> <time_token_70> rice, I told you it's ready. What I have done is I packed the rice into this ring mold which <time_token_70> <time_token_71> is available easily in the market. But you can serve it as it is even. It looks pretty <time_token_71> <time_token_72> in a ring mold. And the centre comes for the sauce. So now I am going to prepare a <time_token_72> <time_token_74> small coconut sauce to serve with the rice. So very little oil. Fry a few cumin seeds <time_token_75> <time_token_76> and allow them to cook for a while. It's getting ready. I will fry a little chopped onion. <time_token_77> <time_token_80> Add a little sweet green chilli. It's optional. A few spring onion leaves. And our coconut <time_token_80> <time_token_82> milk. Well, this coconut milk is thick. So you have to add a little water, salt and lemon <time_token_82> <time_token_85> juice. So it becomes just perfect. This is lemon juice. Add salt and a little bit of <time_token_85> <time_token_87> water. So the sauce becomes perfect. And half a teaspoon of the green paste, what we made <time_token_87> <time_token_89> before. That's it. So our green sauce is ready. Looking lovely. Light green and tasty. Cook for <time_token_89> <time_token_91> a while. Then fill the centre. So the coconut sauce is ready. I am going to put a little bit <time_token_91> <time_token_92> in the centre. If it flows out a little bit, don't worry. It tastes yummy. Flows out a little <time_token_92> <time_token_93> bit covered with the green onion leaves. It's so simple. But this is the way it is served. <time_token_93> <time_token_95> And sprinkle a few spring onions on top. So serve to your friends any given time.

It's nice and sweet meat off there. <time_token_9> <time_token_11> The reason when you buy sashimi you should be a little bit careful who you <time_token_11> <time_token_11> buy it off. It's not so much about the fish even though the best fish <time_token_11> <time_token_13> obviously works high in oil but it's more about the cleanliness. Japanese <time_token_13> <time_token_15> chefs are highly trained in keeping everything nice and clean and <time_token_15> <time_token_17> keeping the bacteria nice and low. It's most important that the benches are <time_token_17> <time_token_18> spotless and the knives are spotless and the hands are nice and clean which is <time_token_18> <time_token_19> all part of their trade. He's coming in, he splits it down the middle on <time_token_20> <time_token_20> the bloodline and cutting into the bone. <time_token_22> <time_token_24> Actually inside the fish there should be no dangerous bacteria <time_token_24> <time_token_24> until we introduce it. That's why the knives and the hands have to be <time_token_24> <time_token_26> spotlessly clean. If it's not, the bacteria is getting introduced to it <time_token_26> <time_token_27> and then we're eating it raw and that's where you have all the problems. That's <time_token_27> <time_token_28> why you really should only buy sashimi off people that you can really trust <time_token_28> <time_token_29> that know this stuff. It comes along the backbone. <time_token_31> <time_token_33> That's one loin. You also have to be careful not to tear the meat. You have to <time_token_33> <time_token_33> cut the meat away so you can get nice blocks of sashimi. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> That's one beautiful loin of yellowfin tuna. We'll get the other side. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> We're only going to do one side of this. You can see you just alternate do it <time_token_37> <time_token_39> the other way. There's a bone that goes down the middle. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> He just cuts through that around it and then along the bone. They're quite <time_token_40> <time_token_41> expensive fish so it's very important to get all the meat away. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> You have a yellowfin as well in excess of $1,000. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Basically, it's very important to cut the meat away, not to rip it. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> As you can see also, once the meat's taken away, we don't like laying it all over the <time_token_50> <time_token_51> boards. Even though the boards have been sanitized, it's better to keep it all open. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> Another beautiful loin. Place that over there. Now he'll just scrape the <time_token_53> <time_token_54> bones. The meat on the bone is very sweet and ideal for sushi or even <time_token_54> <time_token_55> raw for sashimi. It's very easy just with a spoon. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> An expert sashimi chef gets very little amount of waste. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> We won't bother with the other side. You just repeat the process. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> Okay, so just move that away. Again, most important thing to clean the bench down. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> He's just getting some water. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> The bench is cleaned down. It's already had been sanitized. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Okay, so now we're just going to clean a loin up and cut a few blocks for sashimi. <time_token_69> <time_token_71> It normally cuts it into three pieces, depending on the size of the fish. This is only a small <time_token_71> <time_token_72> one. The smaller the fish, the lighter the color, usually the less oil. There's also a <time_token_72> <time_token_73> lot of other reasons for less oil. When the fish are caught, they're caught on a long <time_token_73> <time_token_74> loin and some fish are actually dead when they're brought in. Those ones there are <time_token_74> <time_token_76> very low grade. We stick with the live online ones with higher oil content, <time_token_76> <time_token_77> which gives us the best tasting sashimi. Okay, there's a blood line. The blood line's taken out. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> It's just along the middle of the loin. Okay, that's removed and thrown away. <time_token_78> <time_token_83> Now we have the block. So then the surface is cut into blocks. The rest of it would be <time_token_83> <time_token_84> cut into blocks as well. Just for the day, we'll just take the top one off. The rest of it, <time_token_84> <time_token_86> you'd just skin it and cut it the same way. Okay, now we have the block. You cut the block <time_token_86> <time_token_88> in half again. He cuts it along the grain and then against the grain. Japanese traditional <time_token_88> <time_token_90> style is probably a little thicker than the Asian style or Western style. Very sharp knife. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Knife's only sharpened on one side and they just cut straight back. One thing about Japanese <time_token_91> <time_token_92> chefs is their artistry and display. It's all part of the display. And there we go.

Today's recipe is really, really delicious. It's a version of <time_token_1> <time_token_3> tabbouleh using roasted bulgur and tons and tons of one of my very favorite herbs, parsley. <time_token_3> <time_token_5> I can't wait to share it with you. The first thing that you need to do though is roast <time_token_5> <time_token_6> three pints of cherry tomatoes. These aren't actually cherry tomatoes, they're grape tomatoes. <time_token_6> <time_token_8> That's okay too. Just slice them in half. Look at all those tomatoes. Doesn't that look good? <time_token_8> <time_token_10> Spread the tomatoes out on a rimmed baking sheet. They're going to fill a whole rimmed baking sheet <time_token_10> <time_token_12> and then drizzle with about five teaspoons of oil, give or take. You know me, I'll probably go a <time_token_12> <time_token_13> little bit more heavy-handed but you can use five teaspoons. I love olive oil and I think it's really <time_token_13> <time_token_15> good for you. And this is a Mediterranean recipe so it should have plenty of oil. Sprinkle with salt <time_token_15> <time_token_17> and just give it a shake or toss it up. And then the other thing that makes this recipe really <time_token_17> <time_token_18> special besides the roasted tomatoes is roasted bulgur. So I have one cup of bulgur and I'm putting <time_token_18> <time_token_20> that on a smaller baking sheet. The tomatoes and the bulgur both go into a 450 degree oven. Tomatoes <time_token_20> <time_token_22> for 30 minutes, bulgur for about 15. Normally use just a plain bulgur that's simmered in water. <time_token_22> <time_token_24> Today we're going to roast it so that it gets a really nice depth of toasty flavor. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> While that stuff starts roasting I'm going to get my onion ready. I have one medium red onion. I'm <time_token_26> <time_token_27> just going to slice it and then halfway through the tomato roasting I'm going to add this onion. <time_token_27> <time_token_30> I like to remove the core for this so that they fall apart into little slices. So slice your red <time_token_30> <time_token_32> onion into very thin slices. It's going to roast with the tomatoes for about 15 minutes in the oven. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> I love this recipe because it takes sort of a classic light salad and gives it a lot of depth <time_token_33> <time_token_35> of flavor by roasting all the ingredients except the parsley. The parsley does not get roasted. <time_token_35> <time_token_37> And here we have my favorite ingredient what makes a tabbouleh, a tabbouleh, the parsley. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> I have two pretty big bunches of flat leaf parsley, well washed, well dried. I beg of you <time_token_39> <time_token_41> if ever there's a time to wash and really well dry your parsley it's when you're making tabbouleh. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> If you don't and it's soggy you'll be so so sad. And you'll say Sarah implored me, implored me to <time_token_43> <time_token_45> wash and dry my parsley really well and I didn't do it now I understand why. It's because I love <time_token_45> <time_token_46> you I'm just telling you. Once you have your big huge pile of parsley then you want to coarsely <time_token_46> <time_token_48> chop it. This pile is so big I don't even know if I'm going to be able to chop it. I'm chopping and <time_token_48> <time_token_50> chopping and chopping the pile is definitely getting smaller. If you have a food processor <time_token_50> <time_token_51> and you want to do this in your food processor that's totally cool just don't over process it. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> You're not looking for a pesto texture here you want a coarse chop. Okay that looks good. I'm <time_token_53> <time_token_54> going to add the onions to the tomatoes now and get the bulgur out of the oven. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> Bulgur out and then to the tomatoes add the onion. Add your onion to the tomatoes <time_token_57> <time_token_58> stir it around and then back in the oven for about 15 minutes. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Tomatoes and the onions go back in for about 15 more minutes <time_token_60> <time_token_62> and while that's finishing cooking you can cook your bulgur. It's been roasted for flavor and <time_token_62> <time_token_64> now it needs to simmer in two cups of water for about 15 minutes to hydrate. My tomatoes and <time_token_64> <time_token_66> onions are out of the oven. Once the bulgur has cooked for 15 minutes just let it cool off a <time_token_66> <time_token_67> little bit and I've combined that with one can of drained chickpeas just a little bit of extra <time_token_67> <time_token_69> protein. Now it's just time to combine everything. Take your tomatoes, onions combine it with your <time_token_69> <time_token_71> chickpeas and bulgur. This is a really really hearty tabbouleh. Almost I would venture to say <time_token_71> <time_token_73> a main course tabbouleh. So add your tomatoes and onions to the chickpeas and bulgur and then all <time_token_73> <time_token_75> your parsley probably like a cup and a half of parsley. You know that's making me happy. Is it <time_token_75> <time_token_78> going to make you happy? I hope so. And then a tablespoon of olive oil give or take salt and then <time_token_78> <time_token_79> lemon juice to taste. The salt and lemon juice are really to taste so I'm going to start with a half <time_token_79> <time_token_80> a lemon. We'll see where that goes. I bet I'll need more but you never know. You don't want to <time_token_80> <time_token_83> overdo it right but this is a big salad. Stir it up. Look at that. Party, lunch, dinner, <time_token_83> <time_token_85> I don't know breakfast. I think this is a platter worthy dish. What about you? Make sure you taste <time_token_85> <time_token_86> it in just for seasoning to your liking. If you want to add a little bit of feta cheese to this <time_token_86> <time_token_88> and make it un-vegan go ahead. This recipe makes plenty for tonight's dinner and tomorrow's lunch <time_token_88> <time_token_90> so save some, pack it up and take it to the office and watch everybody be super jealous. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Where'd you get the recipe? Sarah gave it to me and let me tell you roasting the bulgur really <time_token_91> <time_token_92> does make a difference. You could skip that step by suppose but why bother? <time_token_93> <time_token_95> I'm gonna eat this whole platter. Healthy, happy and hearty. It's fantastico guys.

It makes a great, great dip. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> And here is the finished product. <time_token_91> <time_token_96> You could add roasted bell peppers or really anything you like to your hummus, but this is just a very simple roasted garlic recipe. <time_token_96> <time_token_98> If you have any questions, let me know.

"asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_3> Hey everybody, Thomas Joseph here with another kitchen conundrum. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> Well, not technically a kitchen conundrum, but it is something that everybody's looking <time_token_4> <time_token_5> forward to this time of year, and that is game day treats. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> And today I'm going to show you one of the things that's really close to me, and that <time_token_6> <time_token_7> is buffalo chicken wings, because I am from buffalo. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> So I'm going to show you that buffalo chicken wings are really easy to make at home, and <time_token_8> <time_token_10> you don't need to spend the money going out and buying them for the game day. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> To start, I have a large Dutch oven here filled with about four inches of neutral oil. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> So that is like a safflower oil, a canola oil, any vegetable oil, something that can <time_token_12> <time_token_13> go up to a high, high heat. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> And to this pot, I'm going to add a wire rack. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> Now, this is one of my favorite tricks here whenever I'm deep frying. <time_token_14> <time_token_16> Using a rack in the bottom of the pot, what that does is it helps to fry things nice <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Just use some tongs to help yourself out there. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> So what that wire rack does is it helps to lift the food off the bottom of the pan so <time_token_18> <time_token_20> you get really nicely evenly cooked food without any brown or burnt spots from hitting the <time_token_20> <time_token_21> I'm going to use a deep fat thermometer here. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> This is a candy thermometer, and I need to heat the oil up to about 400 degrees. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> And now, while this oil comes up to heat, I'm going to show you how to cut the wings <time_token_23> <time_token_24> into the appropriate size pieces. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> This is what you're going to get at your supermarket. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> This is a chicken wing here, and I'm going to separate it into three parts. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> The first part here is the drumette, and all you have to do is look for the joint of the <time_token_27> <time_token_28> chicken wing, cut through the skin, bend it a little bit, and it should pop out. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> The joint should pop out right there, and now you know where to cut. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> So this is the drumette. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> And so this portion, believe it or not, is called the wingette. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> You want to do the same thing here, where you take the wingtip, which is this portion, <time_token_32> <time_token_33> you break the joint, and then you should be able to cut cleanly through. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> We're not going to fry up this wingtip here. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Place this in a resealable plastic bag in your freezer, and you'll have this for whenever <time_token_35> <time_token_35> you need to make chicken stock. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> And here you go, your wingette. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> So our oil is almost up to temperature. <time_token_36> <time_token_38> And now for the wings, take a piece of paper towel here and gently dab off any excess moisture, <time_token_38> <time_token_39> because if you have excess moisture on your chicken wings, once you place them in the <time_token_39> <time_token_40> hot oil, they're really going to spatter up. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> So dry them off really well. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> You don't want your wings to be too cold either, so don't take these right out of the refrigerator <time_token_42> <time_token_43> and plunge them into the oil, otherwise it will lower the temperature of the oil dramatically, <time_token_43> <time_token_44> and your wings will take that much longer to cook. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> So the chicken wings are nice and dry. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Now you want to work in batches. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> You don't want to throw all of the wings in at once, because it will lower the temperature <time_token_46> <time_token_47> of the oil, and the grease will absorb into the chicken wings, and that's not something <time_token_47> <time_token_48> So gently place the wings into the pot, and that rack is really great because the wings <time_token_48> <time_token_49> do sink down to the bottom. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> They're not going to rest on the bottom of the pot. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> They're going to be elevated up. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> And I'm using about four pounds of chicken wings total. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Try to fry your drumettes in one batch and your wingettes in another batch. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Don't mix them up too much, because they do have slightly different cooking times. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> But in general, the wings will cook about 15 to 20 minutes in total. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> So I'm on my last batch of wings here, and you want to make sure that when you pull the <time_token_55> <time_token_56> wings out of the oil, you transfer them onto a wire rack. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> Don't put them onto paper towel, because what that does is that direct contact with paper <time_token_58> <time_token_59> towel creates steam, and one side of your wing will get soggy. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> So use a wire rack to drain them off and to cool them slightly. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Now while I'm working on my last batch here, I'm going to start the sauce. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> And the sauce is the most important thing for your wings. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> All it really is is two ingredients. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> So I have Frank's Red Sauce here. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> That is the real secret ingredient. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> So I have one cup. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> I'm going to place it into the bottom of a small saucepan here, and I'm going to bring <time_token_65> <time_token_66> this up to heat just to a bare simmer. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> It's just up to a bare simmer. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> You can see some bubbles forming. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> And now I'm going to add the butter. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> So I have one cup of hot sauce, and I'm going to add four tablespoons of cold, unsalted <time_token_69> <time_token_70> butter and gradually add it in, whisking until it combines. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> If you wanted a more mild wing, all you have to do is increase the butter a little bit. <time_token_71> <time_token_73> So doing a two to one ratio hot sauce to butter will give you a mild wing. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> This is about a four to one ratio. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> The butter is nicely incorporated into the hot sauce. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> I'm going to turn the heat off and let this cool down slightly before dressing the wings. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> This batch is finally done. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> It's been about 20 minutes, right onto the wire rack to drain. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> So now the chicken wings are going to go right into a bowl here. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> Use a bowl that's wide enough that you can actually toss the wings. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> I'm going to do about half of the batch here. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> I'll add about half of the sauce around the side of the bowl. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> Just swirl the wings around. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> If you're feeling a little daring here, you can gently toss the wings up to coat them <time_token_84> <time_token_85> So our buffalo wings wouldn't be complete without a little bit of blue cheese dipped, <time_token_85> <time_token_87> and that basically is some mayo, a little bit of sour cream, some blue cheese, of course, <time_token_87> <time_token_88> a little bit of lemon and salt and pepper. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> It's the perfect accompaniment to these spicy wings because it helps to cool them off a <time_token_89> <time_token_90> So there you have it, buffalo chicken wings, my recipe to you. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> So if you have any kitchen conundrums that you need solved, write in the comment section <time_token_91>

<time_token_8> <time_token_10> This is Moule Marigner or Mussels in white wine, and it's so simple. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> To start with, we need fresh mussels, so they've got to still be alive. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> So if you take a mussel and just check it, it's going to be as fresh as possible, and <time_token_12> <time_token_13> alive isn't going to get much fresh than that. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> You can actually see they're still reacting. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> Oh, they're closing. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> They actually react to... <time_token_15> <time_token_15> Tout de la morte. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> You can see that actually close up. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> So what we need to do, if you guys can just clean through this, get rid of any of this <time_token_17> <time_token_18> It's stuck in there, and some of you just need that pulling out, so they're left nice <time_token_18> <time_token_18> and clean, and just check they're also alive. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> So we're just going to boil these alive, by the way. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Yes, boil them alive. <time_token_20> <time_token_23> And over this side, I'm going to start making white wine sauce, which needs onion, because <time_token_23> <time_token_23> we're going to finely dice, and then some garlic. <time_token_23> <time_token_25> So why don't... if this is so easy and quick, why don't people ever do this at home? <time_token_25> <time_token_25> Why do you have to go to a restaurant? <time_token_25> <time_token_26> I think people are scared of them, aren't they? <time_token_26> <time_token_27> They say they might have them when they're out in a restaurant, but they won't bother <time_token_27> <time_token_27> doing it at home. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> I mean, you see how quick this is. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> Effectively, this is French fast food. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> Of course, we've got our onion diced up there. <time_token_30> <time_token_33> That's going to go into a pan with a little bit of oil, and a lot of butter, and our onions <time_token_33> <time_token_33> can go in there. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> Nice, hot pan. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> A little bit. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> And with that, some garlic. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> So why is it, Mike, that you're so scared of seafood? <time_token_37> <time_token_39> I think a lot of it is to do with people don't know the texture of certain foods, and... <time_token_39> <time_token_39> I can't stand smoked salmon. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Yeah, I don't know. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> I just can't stand that. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> For the texture reason. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Yeah, and wine, the taste. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> I love salmon with ginger. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> Garlic's very French, isn't it? <time_token_42> <time_token_43> They wear it around their necks and stuff. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> Yes, they do. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Do they have a lot of vampires in France? <time_token_44> <time_token_44> Is that the reason? <time_token_44> <time_token_45> No, they're just a big fan of garlic, and so am I. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> It should go in a lot of... especially on white wine stores. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> I love garlic. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> I'm not French, but I'm a big fan of garlic. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> How about that? <time_token_48> <time_token_48> Have you ever been to France before? <time_token_49> <time_token_49> I've had a couple of times. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> I did take a girl up the Eiffel Tower once. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> She didn't like it. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> How are we doing, though? <time_token_51> <time_token_51> Is it all about there? <time_token_51> <time_token_51> I think they're beardless. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> OK, so our onion and garlic are pretty much sweated off. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> I'm going to add a squeeze of lemon juice. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> I think we've tapped as many as we can. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Well, they're nearly ready to go in the pan. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> I just need to add the white wine. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Obviously, the key element in our white wine sauce. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> That's something for you guys. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> My fishy fingers. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Just bring that up to a boil, and then our mussels, which you guys have kindly prepared, <time_token_60> <time_token_61> are all going to go in there. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Straight into the pan. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> And that is Mont Maigner, pretty much there. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> So we'll leave it for a couple of minutes just to steam, and we'll go. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> I've heard the French were right if they need the toilet. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> What is that? <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Well, they've got too loose. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> I think, aside from that, we should be about there. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> All our mussels have opened up now. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> You see how they all open up?

You just add about half a teaspoon to maximum. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> You can add 1 tablespoon not more than that. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Just give this a good stir and get this to a boil and allow this to cook thoroughly. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> Once the oil surfaces, add the coriander leaves and squeeze in about half a lime juice. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> And your curry is ready. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> As you can see, it turned out exactly like a restaurant style. <time_token_85> <time_token_87> Do give this recipe a try.

Hi, it's a nice sunny morning and I've got a few of my friends coming over to my place. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> So I'm just going to cook off some nice crunchy vegan Caesar salad for them. <time_token_5> <time_token_5> So I'm doing a vegan Caesar salad. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> The original recipe has got anchovies and eggs in it. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> I'm going to do it without the egg and without the anchovies. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> So around 7-8 cloves of garlic, so it's just nice and crushed garlic. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> Now pour some salt over this and just kind of mash it through. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> So we're just chopping the garlic now. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> I'll use some vegan mayonnaise, which is without the eggs. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> A lot of people do ask me what is vegan and what is vegetarian. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> The difference, if you are vegan, you don't even have dairy products. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> So some nice and freshly ground black pepper into this. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> People use a lot of red wine vinegar or red wine into this. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> But I'm just going to use a humble lemon juice that really adds that zing to the salad. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> And then with some cheese, the best to go with this is parmesan. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> So now I'm just adding the cheese to it. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> But as I was saying, if you are strictly a vegan, you can always use a soya based cheese, <time_token_19> <time_token_20> which is non-lactose. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> So I've got a nice whisk. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> So I'm just mixing the dressing now, nice and thick, creamy. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> If you feel it's too thick, you can add a bit more of lemon juice or any vinegar. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> Vinegar tends to thin down the dressing, any dressing. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> So a little bit more of lemon juice into it, lovely. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Now the Caesar dressing is ready. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> You don't have to be very particular about this because this is what is going to give <time_token_26> <time_token_26> the taste to your salad. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> So let's taste it first. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> As I would have wanted it. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> A Caesar salad is complete without good croutons or nice crunchy rustic bread. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> You can use a regular white bread or a sliced bread. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> You can use any loaf if you have a slightly older loaf. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> I'm using a burger bun, which is as good as any loaf. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> So just slice into it, here we go. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Nice big chunks, so no tiny stuff here. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> Nice and big rustic croutons. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Into the pan first, let's put this on. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> And then a good dollop of butter into this. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Now here if you're slightly concerned about making it more healthy, what you could do <time_token_37> <time_token_38> is you could sprinkle some olive oil, pepper, like I am doing here. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> A little bit salt here, that's it. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> Some garlic flakes again. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> As I said, if you wish, you can always bake them in the oven. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> You can drizzle some olive oil if you don't want butter. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> But you know, it gives it that nutty, crunchy taste. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> So I always prefer butter. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> And in fact, I'm going to add a little bit so they're nicely crisper. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> So my croutons are getting ready here, my dressing is already ready. <time_token_45> <time_token_47> Now what is left is the main salad, for which I'm going to use some red peppers, some yellow <time_token_47> <time_token_47> peppers, nicely diced, almost done there. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> Let's put this off. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> So you can see this little garlic that I was talking about, it's all crisped up. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> This is what we want, nice and crispy, golden brown, lovely. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> Add this to this. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Just slightly cook it in the same flavour that the garlic has given out. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> But not too much, you don't want to lose the crunchiness. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Romaine for the deep flavour and iceberg for the nice bit of crunch. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> So I'm going to mix equal quantities of the romaine and the iceberg. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> You don't need to really go delicate. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> Just twist this off, same again here. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Just rip this apart. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> Once again, nice and crunchy, large chunks. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> You've got some nice romaine here. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> And now with the iceberg, the same thing. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> There's no need to use your knife, your fingers are good enough. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> So some nice and crunchy iceberg. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> Just one important tip here. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> If you're using any kind of lettuce, make sure it's nicely washed because it's raw. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> But the most important aspect is, you drain it nicely, otherwise there's going to be a <time_token_62> <time_token_63> lot of water in your lettuce and that's going to make your salad watery. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> You don't want that. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> So some nice lettuce now, no excess water. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> Few nice cherry tomatoes underneath my palm. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> And here goes my knife like this. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> Okay, so we've got these tomatoes into this. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> This few hole maybe here. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> So nicely chopped sweet basil leaves. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Of course this is not statutory, I mean it's not compulsory to add basil. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> I like it because it gives a fresh feel and flavour to the salad. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> So we've got this here. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Some cracked pepper into this. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> If you want it a little bit spicy, you could always add a bit of chilli flakes to it, maybe <time_token_73> <time_token_73> a bit of Tabasco to it. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> It's all your taste. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> Now with the dressing, a little bit of the dressing inside, not too much. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> You know, dressing, whenever you add to a salad, it's got lemon juice, it's got some <time_token_75> <time_token_76> kind of acidity. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> So what it does it, it makes your salad slightly wilted and soft. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> So dressing should be added absolutely at the last minute when almost you're ready to <time_token_78> <time_token_78> serve the salad. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> So I'm just going to pick it up nicely with my fingers, nice and light. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> Just place it in the centre like this. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> Don't press the leaves too much. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> You don't want them to sit down. <time_token_81> <time_token_83> And then the lovely cherry tomatoes, some of them, pick, pick, pick. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> Now with the extra dressing, just dollops of it around because too much is going to make <time_token_85> <time_token_85> a salad watery. <time_token_85> <time_token_87> So now with the peppers and the kultans, here they go, all over the top. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Isn't it looking amazing? <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Yes, always if you make them look good and if you really get good flavour in it, it's <time_token_89> <time_token_90> a meal by itself. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> And now the cheese that we have left over goes on top, lovely. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> And the last bit of cracked pepper on the top. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Now what I've done is I've just slightly thinned down my dressing. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> You can do it with water and just the thinned down dressing. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> My mia, my sisi salad is ready. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> I can't just wait to dig into this. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> So I've made my own. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> If you guys go to Macon, you know how to do it. <time_token_98> <time_token_98> So then why the wait? <time_token_98> <time_token_98> Please go ahead.

304.........................................", "asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_1> Hi, I'm YouTube's Donald Skian and I hear you're looking for a great breakfast recipe. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> Here's a doozy. <time_token_2> <time_token_4> Eggs Benedict is an absolute classic brunch recipe and it is comprised of toasted English <time_token_4> <time_token_6> muffins, beautiful sharp and buttery hollandaise sauce, and creamy poached eggs, and a little <time_token_6> <time_token_6> bit of savoury ham as well. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> It is simple to make but you need to take time and concentrate. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> I have two eggs in a large heat-proof bowl, give them a good whisk up and we're going <time_token_8> <time_token_9> to stick these over a pan of simmering water. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> So as this simmers away and starts to heat up we're going to add one or two knobs of <time_token_10> <time_token_11> butter and slowly but surely this is going to melt into our sauce. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> Right we're going to add more butter in and you kind of have to keep doing it and keep <time_token_13> <time_token_14> going and you'll notice that the sauce starts to thicken up under the heat or over the heat <time_token_14> <time_token_15> and it's just a case of adding more and more butter until you have a nice voluptuous sauce. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> So I'm adding my final little bit of butter in here and once that's melted down we have <time_token_17> <time_token_18> a fantastic hollandaise sauce that just needs a kick of flavour from some lemon juice and <time_token_18> <time_token_18> some sea salt. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> I'm going to take it off the heat at this point, give this a last whisk through and <time_token_19> <time_token_20> you can see how beautiful and yellow that hollandaise sauce is. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> It just needs to be hit with a tiny touch of lemon juice, give that lemon a little bit <time_token_22> <time_token_22> of a roll on the board and a quick squeeze. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> It only needs about a teaspoon of lemon juice and if you're doing this squeezing it straight <time_token_23> <time_token_25> in do do it through your hands so you get any of those pips left, okay that should do <time_token_25> <time_token_26> A little hit of some sea salt in here will make all the difference in terms of flavour. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> You could add a bit of black pepper in there but I don't think purists would be too happy. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Give it a last little whisk through, it should maintain that thickness even when you <time_token_28> <time_token_30> add the lemon juice and that my friend is a very delicious and simple hollandaise sauce. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Set this aside, we now need to talk about our poaching liquid for our eggs. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> I have this come to a rolling simmer and you don't want it to be a really hard boil, you <time_token_32> <time_token_33> want it to be a nice steady simmer. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Keep it on a low temperature, we're adding a tablespoon of white wine vinegar. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Now the theory is that a tablespoon of white wine vinegar and the pinch of salt I'm going <time_token_35> <time_token_36> to add now will make all the difference to bringing your poached eggs together. <time_token_36> <time_token_38> The method I use is slightly different because normally everyone goes in there and swirls <time_token_38> <time_token_39> it around, I'm just swirling it very gently to dissolve the salt but I don't actually <time_token_39> <time_token_40> swirl my water, I just pop my egg in very gently because it is poached eggs or something <time_token_40> <time_token_40> that not everyone gets right. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> So this is my little trick and it's the way I always make my poached eggs, it's always <time_token_41> <time_token_42> a very simple one and even if you've never poached an egg before, this method I hope <time_token_42> <time_token_43> I can guarantee will work for you. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> So in a little cup, bring your cup right to the edge of the water and just drop it on <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Okay, my egg has had its time and there is a tendency when they come out of the water <time_token_46> <time_token_47> that they look a little bit miserable so if you have these little extra bits that are <time_token_47> <time_token_48> around the sides, just use a butter knife and chop it off so you have a nice edge to <time_token_48> <time_token_49> your lovely poached egg, fantastic. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Got my poached eggs, got my hollandaise and now it's time to assemble. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> I have some toasted English muffins and we're going to just assemble these up with a little <time_token_53> <time_token_53> bit of ham on the bottom here. <time_token_53> <time_token_55> I've got nice thinly sliced pieces of ham and they really do add a lovely savoury kick <time_token_55> <time_token_56> so I always use ham but you can do it with smoked salmon, you can add a little bit of <time_token_56> <time_token_56> cooked spinach in here is quite nice as well. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> So really this is a recipe you can adapt to your own liking but this is more of the classic <time_token_58> <time_token_59> way of serving it so we've got a nice little bit of ham and now it's time for our fantastic <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Straight on top with your poached eggs, beautifully poached so that you have that runny yolk and <time_token_61> <time_token_63> nicely set egg white, just lift them very gently on top and what brings together this <time_token_63> <time_token_65> whole dish is that wonderful hollandaise sauce. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> So let's get our last little whisk through just so that it is nice and ready. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> I'm going to lose my whisk, take a big spoon or a small spoon in this case and just spread <time_token_68> <time_token_69> that over the top, look at that. <time_token_69> <time_token_71> Fantastic flavours, really sharp hollandaise sauce and when you dive through that egg yolk <time_token_71> <time_token_71> you are in business. <time_token_71> <time_token_73> The only thing this needs now is a little fresh hit of some chives over the top, I'm <time_token_73> <time_token_73> just going to give them a quick snip with the scissors. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> I'm kind of going a little bit creative here now but I quite like that. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> Just a nice little snip, gives you all that wonderful sort of onion flavour and you can <time_token_76> <time_token_77> give it a final touch of some black pepper and then that my friends is a serious breakfast <time_token_77> <time_token_77> and a half. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> I'm going to give it that little crack of black pepper. <time_token_78> <time_token_80> And the last thing to do now is slice right through that so you get really nice yolk pouring <time_token_80> <time_token_80> and I'm going to get you to come in and have a look at this. <time_token_81> <time_token_83> Oh yes, this is what your egg benedict is all about, dripping egg yolk, wonderful hollandaise <time_token_83> <time_token_84> sauce and that savoury ham, just give me a minute. <time_token_84> <time_token_86> Mmm, that has to be one of my absolute favourite breakfast that I now have all over my hand. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> It is so delicious, it's an absolute classic and it's a very easy recipe to make. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> This is a brunch that is bound to impress your friends. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> If you want the recipe you can

We're getting into the St. Patrick's Day spirit here in the <time_token_2> <time_token_5> resource kitchen with chef Justin Wiley. He's making Irish boxy. Yes, it's an old <time_token_5> <time_token_8> Irish pancake. A potato pancake. So good in here. And so we're gonna start out <time_token_8> <time_token_12> with one and a half cups of grated potato. And the important thing when <time_token_12> <time_token_14> you're grating a potato, they have a lot of moisture. So you want to take like a <time_token_14> <time_token_16> nice flour sack towel. Okay. Like I have right here. And get the potato in there <time_token_16> <time_token_19> and just squeeze it all out. Really? Yeah, you want to get all the water after you've <time_token_19> <time_token_21> grated it. And then this is what you want after. This is the starch that's <time_token_21> <time_token_24> leftover and it will help bind the potato. Wow. Yeah. So we're gonna go ahead <time_token_24> <time_token_26> and do one cup of all-purpose flour. Now real quick, what kind of potatoes did you <time_token_26> <time_token_30> use? I'm using Yukon Golds. Okay. And we're gonna just coat the potato with the <time_token_30> <time_token_33> flour. So I'm wondering how you got that juice. Okay. I know you said because it's <time_token_33> <time_token_35> not. Yeah, you squeeze the water out and the starch will sink to the bottom and <time_token_35> <time_token_37> you just drain the water off. Okay. Okay. I'm trying to picture this. And then a <time_token_37> <time_token_41> separate bowl. You want to take one egg. Okay. And about one tablespoon of skim <time_token_41> <time_token_45> milk and with the nice whip with whatever you want to say, get it going like that. Okay. And then if we <time_token_45> <time_token_48> want to be interactive, so dump about one cup of already mashed potato. Oh, it came <time_token_48> <time_token_51> out. Okay. It came out perfect. Oh, those mashed potatoes look good too. And we're gonna go and just <time_token_51> <time_token_54> incorporate the egg and the skim milk with the mashed potato. Now do you make <time_token_54> <time_token_56> like regular mashed potatoes if you put like, you know, sour cream or whatever. Yeah, it's regular. So these are, these <time_token_56> <time_token_64> are gonna be a little bit, you know, a little bit more fancier because those mashed potatoes have sour cream and cream cheese and all sorts of goodies in them. Delicious. And then we're gonna take that start that remains about, you know, about 20 <time_token_64> <time_token_72> minutes afterwards out of there and incorporate that into the mixture and then just salt and pepper. Now, how do you recommend making your mashed potatoes? Oh, I leave the <time_token_72> <time_token_87> skins on, you know, boil them for, you know, until they're fork tender and then put them in a KitchenAid mixture and butter and yeah. All the delicious things. Work with them while they're hot. You have to be a little bit careful, but, you know, they're pretty easy. And then the grated potatoes that are coated with the flour, we want to go ahead and mix in. Okay. And you want to get, you're looking for like, kind of like a, you know, a thicker batter. Okay. <time_token_87> <time_token_98> And then, yeah, sorry, we're running out of time. And then we're gonna go ahead and just put them in the pan. I'll let them go for a while. Yeah, that's it. And just kind of watch until they're brown. About three minutes on each side. Ah, delicious. Can't wait to try them. All right, well, we'll try this in just a little bit. Okay, thank you.

I love the texture of this <time_token_11> <time_token_11> Regular white sugar is perfect <time_token_11> <time_token_12> Now I'm using a 1 1 by 2 cup of black glutinous <time_token_12> <time_token_13> Rice wine, but like a mirin would be great. You don't have to use this. This is again just something I like to use <time_token_14> <time_token_15> One half of a white onion and this is a medium-sized, you know white sweet onion <time_token_16> <time_token_16> 1 1 by 2 cup of honey <time_token_18> <time_token_19> Now this is something that is going to probably raise a few eyebrows, but it's awesome stuff and it's fish sauce <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Now it doesn't taste fishy. It's kind of a distilled flavor <time_token_20> <time_token_21> But what it is, it's a flavor enhancer and I'm telling you in sauces this stuff is it's a miracle worker <time_token_21> <time_token_22> It brings out and enhances flavors does not make it taste like fish. I swear to you. It does not make it taste like fish <time_token_23> <time_token_23> tablespoons of freshly minced <time_token_23> <time_token_25> Ginger now if you don't have access to fresh ginger use powdered ginger <time_token_25> <time_token_25> But there's a special way that I learned of <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Processing this and getting it ready for the sauce if you don't do it this way <time_token_26> <time_token_27> You're gonna end up with like fibers and you'll end up with hairy meat, which is awful <time_token_27> <time_token_28> So what I'll do is I'll first peel the root slice it into like coin shapes <time_token_28> <time_token_29> then you're going to smash it with the side of your knife and <time_token_29> <time_token_30> what that does is it pulverizes all the fibers and then you just finally mince it up and <time_token_30> <time_token_30> You won't have that problem with the hairs <time_token_31> <time_token_31> And I'm using one tablespoon <time_token_31> <time_token_32> There's a lot of sweet going on here and I like just a little bit of warmth in the back of your throat <time_token_32> <time_token_33> This is Korean chili paste. I butcher the real name, but it's a good Chang or something like that <time_token_33> <time_token_34> I'll put it up. But if you can't find this just any chili paste will work fine <time_token_34> <time_token_35> All right. Now last but certainly not least my favorite ingredient in this marinade and that's fresh Asian <time_token_35> <time_token_37> Pear now if you don't have access to Asian pear just a regular Bosch pear would work <time_token_37> <time_token_38> I mean even probably canned pears in a pinch, but this just makes this recipe is a nice clean crisp <time_token_39> <time_token_39> Flavor to it. Now, let's get this blended up <time_token_39> <time_token_41> Now I like to start out at a lower speed on the blender here just to get everything chopped without splashing all over the place <time_token_41> <time_token_41> Then just start increasing the speed <time_token_42> <time_token_43> All right, so here's the meat we're gonna be cooking now <time_token_43> <time_token_44> This is three pounds of beef short ribs and it's cut it's called flank in style <time_token_44> <time_token_44> Which just basically means it's been cut across the bone <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Most butcher stores will have this if not <time_token_45> <time_token_46> You can request that it be cut this way. I personally ask for it to be cut custom anyway <time_token_46> <time_token_47> I just like it a little bit thicker than the ribs that they're selling and <time_token_47> <time_token_49> One little tip what I like to do before I prepare these is I'll just take the tip of a knife and <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Scrape the meat you're gonna have dust on here from the bone saw from the bandsaw <time_token_50> <time_token_51> They use and I like to get all that off before I put this in a marinade. All right, let's get these things in a marinade <time_token_51> <time_token_52> All right, so pretty basic stuff. We're gonna take the container personally. I like using these things <time_token_52> <time_token_53> They're made by camera have a nice tight lid on them. You can stack them <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Put the ribs in here <time_token_54> <time_token_54> Trying to make an effort to make sure they're not, you know sticking together side by side <time_token_55> <time_token_55> Now the marinade <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Just cook the ribs of the marinade <time_token_56> <time_token_57> What I'm gonna do now is <time_token_57> <time_token_57> Put the lid on I want to make sure first they're fully immersed in this marinade <time_token_57> <time_token_58> put it in the fridge and <time_token_58> <time_token_59> They'll be marinating for about four to five hours before we start this cook a little longer spine <time_token_59> <time_token_60> I mean if you want to marinate them overnight, but these are gonna be about five hours. Anyway, I'll see at the grill <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Alright guys, we're gonna start grilling up these short ribs now <time_token_61> <time_token_61> And I'm gonna start off doing it a little differently than I used to do my short ribs <time_token_61> <time_token_62> I used to use a direct heat throughout the entire cook now <time_token_62> <time_token_63> I'm starting off with an indirect heat and the reason I'm doing this is, you know, there's a lot of sugar in this sauce <time_token_63> <time_token_64> And what I'm gonna do is just sort of get the caramelization going now <time_token_64> <time_token_65> rather than having this hot, you know, this sweet stuff dripping into this <time_token_65> <time_token_66> hot coals and starting flare-ups and <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Then what I'll do is more of a kind of a I guess you could call it a <time_token_67> <time_token_67> Reverse sear. We'll sear these after they're <time_token_68> <time_token_68> pretty much cooked <time_token_69> <time_token_70> In case I didn't mention it when I took it out of the marinade what I did was just more or less shook off the excess <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Okay, you can see the it's starting to kind of cook through the surface now, so I'm gonna go ahead and start flipping these <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Smells really really good <time_token_73> <time_token_74> And this one's a little close to the hot coals, so it's gonna be well done <time_token_75> <time_token_76> These other guys are looking really good <time_token_76> <time_token_77> This is gonna leave us with some very very very juicy meat <time_token_77> <time_token_78> So this you know, these are just a quarter inch thin so they don't need a whole lot of cooking <time_token_78> <time_token_79> All right guys now what we're gonna do is just finish these off and again, it's more like more or less a reverse sear <time_token_80> <time_token_80> Get this on some direct heat <time_token_81> <time_token_82> This will finish off that caramelization <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Alright guys we are done we get these on the platter <time_token_88> <time_token_88> And we're gonna plate it up inside <time_token_88> <time_token_89> All right guys here <time_token_89> <time_token_89> We are having this with some jasmine rice and this is a kind of a slaw that I made <time_token_89> <time_token_90> It's got you know some red cabbage some of that Asian pear a little cucumber some cilantro <time_token_91> <time_token_91> Let's give this a try smells really really good <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Go around these bones here <time_token_92> <time_token_93> I don't know if you can see that really juicy <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Really really really tender I <time_token_94> <time_token_96> Love this recipe. It's got everything I love. It's got a nice amount of sweet just the perfect amount of heat <time_token_96> <time_token_97> It's a winner. Anyway guys.

<time_token_11> <time_token_13> Okay, so we're making fattouche, which is a Lebanese bread salad. <time_token_13> <time_token_15> And I started out, and I have a quarter cup of lemon juice. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> That's about two lemons yielded, and a quarter cup of olive oil. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> And I have a quarter cup of mint, and a quarter cup of parsley in here. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> And you grew this in your garden. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> I grew it in my garden. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> And I can smell it. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> The mint is really strong. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> It smells delicious. <time_token_25> <time_token_28> Then we have a clove of one garlic, or a teaspoon of, if you buy the minced garlic in the thing, <time_token_28> <time_token_29> it's a teaspoon. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> And then this is the secret ingredient. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> The secret ingredient, all right. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> It's called sumac. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> Which is a Middle Eastern, you can only get it in a Middle Eastern grocery store, but <time_token_35> <time_token_37> there is one at 51st and Sheridan, so. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> You can get it. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> Sumac, what is it? <time_token_39> <time_token_40> It's just a spice? <time_token_40> <time_token_40> It's just a spice. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> And it's a unique flavor, but it's really yummy. <time_token_42> <time_token_44> That's about two tablespoons, and then a teaspoon of salt, and a dash of pepper. <time_token_45> <time_token_47> And that's kind of how you make recipes more healthy, is you try to find spices and healthy <time_token_47> <time_token_49> flavors that are really pungent without adding a lot of fat. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Because the flavor actually helps. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> So here we have six cups of lettuce. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> We have, this is three tomatoes. <time_token_55> <time_token_58> Apparently the Lebanese like their tomatoes, so we've got three whole tomatoes here. <time_token_58> <time_token_60> We've got two cups of cucumbers. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Looks all pretty. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Yeah, very colorful. <time_token_62> <time_token_65> And then I do chickpeas. <time_token_65> <time_token_68> Yeah, that's always a good way to make a salad into a meal, adding some protein. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Yeah, it's one can of chickpeas. <time_token_69> <time_token_71> And then this is four green onions. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> This is an ounce of feta. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> And that's also, everything's better with a little cheese. <time_token_76> <time_token_80> And then other secret ingredient for salad is a bread, and it's, a peat of bread is commonly <time_token_80> <time_token_82> used, but you can use other kinds of bread, whatever you have. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> I was wondering, it was called bread salad. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> We had to have some bread in here. <time_token_85> <time_token_89> So then you just put the dressing on top, toss it, and then it's ready to eat. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> You don't want to put the dressing on too early. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Too early or it kind of makes it soggy. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> It's not as good. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> It's a unique recipe. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> Very light for summer when it's hot outside. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> You don't want to cook. <time_token_96> <time_token_98> And of course, we have this recipe online right now at KGRH.com.

Welcome to Madhura's recipe.com developing a new taste. Today we <time_token_1> <time_token_2> are going to make roti, chapati or koi. I have arrested people complaining that their <time_token_2> <time_token_3> roti's are very soft when they are fresh and start to become very hard and chewy as the <time_token_3> <time_token_4> time goes. Today I am going to show you how to prepare extra soft roti. In Maharashtra <time_token_4> <time_token_5> we have prepared layered roti. Today we will see how to prepare this layered roti in two <time_token_5> <time_token_6> different ways. So, let's get started. We will begin with kneading the chapati dough. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> For this we need whole wick flour. Try to use good quality whole wick flour. Take this <time_token_7> <time_token_11> like this. Next we will add some oil about 2 tsp and add some salt just to taste. First <time_token_11> <time_token_13> mix all dry ingredients together. Mix it by hand just like that. Once we mix all dry <time_token_13> <time_token_14> ingredients, now let's add some warm water into it. Make sure you look warm water. Add <time_token_14> <time_token_17> water. Keep on adding small amount of water at a time. This chapati dough is ready. It's <time_token_17> <time_token_18> consistent. This is very soft dough but this is not too thin dough. This is not sticking <time_token_18> <time_token_19> to hand when we press it. This is not too stiff as well. We are easily able to press <time_token_19> <time_token_21> it. This is how we want to knead this chapati dough. Now just cover this otherwise wrap <time_token_21> <time_token_23> in the plastic in length. Keep this dough for about 30 minutes. I have seen that people <time_token_23> <time_token_24> knead the dough and immediately they start to roll the roti. But make sure you keep this <time_token_24> <time_token_24> dough for at least 15 minutes before you start to roll the roti. This is the most important <time_token_24> <time_token_25> part while making roti. This chapati dough has been resting for 30 minutes. Now we will <time_token_25> <time_token_26> start to roll the roti. For this here skillet is heating up on medium to high heat. Now <time_token_26> <time_token_28> take this dough and take just a teaspoon of oil between the palm of your hand and again <time_token_28> <time_token_30> knead this dough just for about a minute just to make it soft. Just like that. Once you knead <time_token_30> <time_token_31> this dough one more time. Now take small balls from this dough. Make a gold ball size <time_token_31> <time_token_33> just like that. First we will make single layer roti. For this dip this ball into a <time_token_33> <time_token_34> dry flour. Coat this well with dry flour. I am using a whole bit flour only and start <time_token_34> <time_token_35> rolling this dough. We need to roll this into an oval shape like that. Roll this into <time_token_35> <time_token_37> an oval shape like this. Now apply some oil over it. Just 3 to 4 drops. Spread this and <time_token_37> <time_token_39> sprinkle some dry flour over it. Just like that. Now press this in between just like that <time_token_39> <time_token_41> and now close this to parts just like that. Again dip this into dry flour and start rolling <time_token_41> <time_token_43> the roti like regular chapati. Roll this like that. This roti is ready now to go on the skillet. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Dry temperature of the skillet is also most important thing while roasting roti. If the <time_token_44> <time_token_45> temperature is too high the roti will get burnt and if it is too low then the roti will <time_token_45> <time_token_46> become very hard and it will let time to get through. I always prefer to roasting on a medium <time_token_46> <time_token_47> to high heat. This skillet is hot enough. Now I am adding this roti. As soon as you <time_token_47> <time_token_48> see small bubbles appearing on the open surface of roti just flip this just like that. You <time_token_48> <time_token_49> can see nice golden spots on the other side of roti. Apply some oil. You may also make <time_token_49> <time_token_52> use of key. Looks good. I am going to apply some oil from this side as well. See it looks <time_token_52> <time_token_55> very fluffy. Roast it from other side. This single layer roti is ready. It is very soft and <time_token_55> <time_token_56> fluffy. When we store hot roti into a pot there are chances that moisture gets stacked <time_token_56> <time_token_58> in the pot immediately due to heat from the roti and this roti becomes wet. Just over that <time_token_58> <time_token_58> make sure you place some paper towel or paper napkin like this below roti. You may also <time_token_58> <time_token_59> make use of cheesecloth. Now we are going to make two layers of roti. For this again <time_token_59> <time_token_61> take small ball length and roll this like puri. Just dip this into dry flour and roll <time_token_61> <time_token_63> it like puri. Once you roll this like puri apply some oil over it. Just a little bit <time_token_63> <time_token_65> spread this. Apply some dry flour like that and make one fork like this. Again apply some <time_token_65> <time_token_68> oil. Spread it. I am going to apply some dry flour over it and just close it. Now dip this <time_token_68> <time_token_70> into dry flour and start rolling like regular roti. This is not inter triangular shape. We <time_token_70> <time_token_72> are going to make it into circular shape like round. I have rolled this roti. Make sure <time_token_72> <time_token_73> you roll this roti evenly from all the sides. It should not be thick around its edges and <time_token_73> <time_token_74> you don't use lots of dry flour while rolling roti. If you use lots of dry flour roti make <time_token_74> <time_token_76> it hard. Now we need to roast this roti. In the same way roast this roti as well. You <time_token_76> <time_token_77> can see bubbles start to appear. Just flip this. You can see nice golden dots. It has <time_token_77> <time_token_80> started to fluff up. Perfect. Apply some oil or ghee. Just flip it. Just like that. Roast <time_token_80> <time_token_83> this nicely from both sides. Perfect. This two layer roti is ready. Make sure its edges <time_token_83> <time_token_85> are also get roasted. It should not be raw. This two layer roti is ready. You can see <time_token_85> <time_token_86> it looks so nice and fluffy. This roti is ready now. The only difference between these <time_token_86> <time_token_87> two roti is single layer roti. It is quite easy to prepare as compared to two layer roti. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> They both taste equally good. Now let's see how they look. Here is my two layer roti. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> You can see this is very very soft and once we break this we can see literally three layers <time_token_91> <time_token_93> out there. This roti is very very soft and this is single layer roti. When we break this <time_token_93> <time_token_94> roti we can see two layers out there. Literally we can break this roti into two parts. This <time_token_94> <time_token_95> roti takes very soft for longer time. It takes soft for 3 to 4 days. If you are eating <time_token_95> <time_token_97> fresh you can eat just like that. If you are having this on the second day just microwave <time_token_97> <time_token_97> them for 15 seconds and they are soft like cotton. Thanks for watching my video.

Welcome back to another episode of Rosie Eats. <time_token_0> <time_token_1> I know it's been a while since my last video, but I promise you this one is going to be worth it. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> Today we're going to be fusing two of my favorite Vietnamese cuisines. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> Banh mi, which is Vietnamese sandwich, and pho, which is a beef noodle soup. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> I'm going to marinate thin cuts of beef with the flavors that you find in pho. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> And we're going to put this into a French baguette and it's going to be absolutely fantastic. <time_token_5> <time_token_5> So let's get started. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> First things first, we're going to start marinating our beef. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> The best way to do this is freeze the piece of meat first and then you can thinly slice the meats very easily. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> So I have my pieces already cut up. I'm going to start mixing my flavors. <time_token_9> <time_token_11> Some of the spices that I'm going to use that is going to mimic a beef pho is going to be star anise. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> I have white pepper powder, coriander, and cinnamon and cloves. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> It's going to be about a half a teaspoon of each. <time_token_12> <time_token_12> I'm going to throw that into my bowl. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> One tablespoon of fish sauce. One tablespoon of white sugar. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> I have two tablespoons of ginger and onion that I pureed. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> One tablespoon of hoisin. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Hoisin sauce is basically plum sauce and you can find it in your international grocery aisle. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> Two tablespoons of vegetable oil. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Green onion that I roughly chopped. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> I'm also going to throw this in. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> I'm also going to add lime zest and juice. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> This lime is kind of dry. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> I'm trying to squeeze as much juice from it as possible. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> We have all the ingredients for our marinade in our bowl. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> We're just going to whisk this up. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> It would help if you have a little bit bigger bowl, but it's nice and thick. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> It's kind of like a paste. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> It smells really good. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> Now that our ingredients are mixed together, we're going to throw that in with our beef. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> Grab a ziplock bag. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> Throw our thinly sliced beef along with our marinade. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Use a spatula to make sure all of that yummy marinade is going into this bag. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Then zip it up and try to squeeze as much air out of this as possible. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> We want that marinade to be very cozy with the beef. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Do your little massage. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Our green onion pieces are going to be cooked along with the beef. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> It's going to be so good. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> I'm telling you guys, I can't wait. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Throw this in the fridge at least 30 minutes. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> I have one already marinated. We're going to start cooking this up. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Hop on over to the stove. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Alright guys, you know what time it is. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> It's time to assemble and eat. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> We just cooked our beef that's marinating in all of those yummy pho flavors. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> I got a nice caramelization on it. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> I toasted my French baguette. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> I'm going to start off with some mayo. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> Usually for a Vietnamese banh mi, they use homemade mayo which is egg yolks. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> That's been emulsified with some canola oil. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Two egg yolks to about a cup of canola oil. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> Basically, you use a blender or a whisk or a stand mixer. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> You're going to slowly pour in the oil while you're whisking your egg yolks. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> It emulsifies into this rich thick butter. It's amazing. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> I'm using regular mayonnaise because I did not do that, but it's still going to be delicious. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> I slathered on some mayo. I'm going to slather on some hoisin sauce on the other side. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Again, hoisin sauce is a plum sauce. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> It's going to add a nice dark sweetness to our sandwich. <time_token_59> <time_token_62> Next, we're going to add our delicious beef that's creaming with flavor. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> It's going to be so good. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Some of the fresh herbs that we use for pho is going to be Thai basil. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> We're going to add some Thai basil leaves. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> You also add bean sprouts to pho. I'm going to add bean sprouts. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> I did this ahead of time. I pickled daikon and carrots because in a traditional Vietnamese banh mi, <time_token_68> <time_token_69> they put pickled daikon and carrots in almost every sandwich. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> It's going to be julienne carrots and daikon that is going to be marinated in about two cups of warm water, <time_token_70> <time_token_71> a fourth a cup of vinegar, about three to four tablespoons of sugar, and a little bit of salt. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> You pickle that for at least a day, but ideally a couple days. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> Throw it in the fridge and you're going to have it handy for any type of sandwich you want <time_token_74> <time_token_75> because it kind of adds a nice tartness, a nice tart crunch to any of your salads or sandwiches. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> It's a must. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Some jalapeno slices and sriracha. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Sriracha is found everywhere. It's in a lot of major restaurants. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> You can also find this in your international aisle in your grocery store. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I'm for sure they have sriracha. I mean, who doesn't know about sriracha? <time_token_79> <time_token_80> Our sandwich is done. We're going to cut this in half and I'm going to eat it. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> I don't know if you guys want to get a close-up on this. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> It looks super amazing and it's a fun take on a traditional Vietnamese dish. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> I don't know if you guys hear that crunch, but definitely a must to toast your baguettes. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> All right, here you have it. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> Pho bien mi sandwich. This is the first song Rosie eats. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Bon appetit. I'm going to take a big bite out of this bad boy. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Delicious. Sorry, I took a really big bite. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Definitely get all of your pho flavors in the meat. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> All right, guys. I hope you guys enjoyed the video. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> I'm going to finish off this sandwich, but let me know your thoughts. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> I hope you love this recipe as much as I do. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> Leave your thoughts and comments below. I'll see you guys next time. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> This time it's hoisin sauce. That's why you wear an apron. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> I feel like I'm getting sweaty at a workout eating this. That was stupid.

<time_token_25> <time_token_25> This smells so good! <time_token_26> <time_token_26> Now, I have been stirring this off and on every couple of minutes <time_token_26> <time_token_26> just to make sure it doesn't stick on the bottom. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> Again, we want these about three-fourths of the way cooked. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> The way we're going to test this out is we're going to take one piece of potato, <time_token_28> <time_token_29> put a knife through it. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> It goes all the way through, but you can feel a little bit of tension in there. <time_token_30> <time_token_30> It's not a raw tension, but it's a smooth tension in there. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> If it does that, then you know it's perfect. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> We'll switch off our stove. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> We're going to add back in our veneer pieces <time_token_32> <time_token_33> and also our cashews and the walnuts. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> We're going to add some tomatoes in there, too. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> Again, chopped nice and big. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> This adds a lot of color. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> Having a firm tomato will really help. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Actually, you can use cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes as well. <time_token_35> <time_token_35> Finally, we have some yogurt. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> We're going to beat it a little bit. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Just roughly beat it so that it's easier to mix. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> I'm going to pour that in. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> Just mix it so it coats evenly. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> This process actually has to do very gently <time_token_39> <time_token_39> because otherwise the cauliflower will just break. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Just do it as gently as possible. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> That's it. It's ready to layer. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> I'm going to go ahead and just fluff up the rice one more time very gently. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> While she's doing that, <time_token_42> <time_token_42> I'm going to cover the bottom and sides of our baking dish <time_token_45> <time_token_45> with some spray cooking oil. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> We're going to put one layer of rice down on the bottom. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> Basically, we're going to have three layers of rice. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> You can split your rice up into three parts <time_token_46> <time_token_47> and you'll know how much to put in each layer. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> On top of the rice, we're going to go ahead <time_token_47> <time_token_48> and sprinkle a little bit of our biryani masala. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> Just a little on top for additional flavor. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> Actually, this is also going to taste. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> If you want it spicier, you can pour the whole thing. <time_token_49> <time_token_49> Or go easy, definitely, because it is a little on the spicy side. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> Also, we're going to layer one layer of our veggies on top of here. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> This is vegetable biryani, <time_token_52> <time_token_53> so we are very generous on the vegetables. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> You don't want to bite into a lot of rice. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> You get a nice ample supply of vegetables here. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> There are two layers of vegetables, so you can divide this into two. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> Now we're going to sprinkle a little bit of our fried onions. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> This really adds a nice crunch and a nice flavor. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> You can try to do this at home, but it's a lot simpler to survive it. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> It always comes down so perfect. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> Now another layer of rice. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> After this, we're just going to press down very lightly. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> It helps it to just pack in really nicely. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> And cook well. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> Another layer of our ground masala. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> I'm putting about one teaspoon of masala between every layer. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> So just a good measure. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> And our second layer of veggies. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Oh, yes, and by the way, our oven has been going on at 400 degrees. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> It's preheated very well, and it's ready for the biryani. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> And one more layer of our onions. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Okay, and our last layer of rice. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Now the last layer is always a little bit lightest on the rice. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> It lets the veggies kind of peek out from the top. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> It looks really pretty. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> And now what we're going to do is we're going to just take some saffron. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> It's got a beautiful color, and you're just going to drizzle it around. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Our saffron has this wonderful flavor and wonderful aroma, and it really makes your biryani. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> So we're going to leave some of it white and some of it, you know, the orange color of the saffron. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> That way when we mix it, it looks, you know, beautiful. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> And a final layering of our fried onions. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> And also some cilantro. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> So this is going to be covered now, and it's going to go into our oven once again, 400 degrees Fahrenheit for about 40 minutes. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> But everybody's ovens are different, so please keep an eye on it. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> You don't want it to burn after all this effort. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> So our biryani is out of the oven. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> It cooked for 45 minutes at 400 degrees, and it is being perfect. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> Oh, look at that. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> It's nicely caramelized. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> The onions have browned and it's ready to serve. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Let's see what it looks like on the inside. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> And I think the key is to just dig right in all the way. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> Then we get all the layers. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> A portion of all the layers. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> And it looks fantastic. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> Look at that. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> See all the veggies are nice and they've held their shape? <time_token_93> <time_token_93> I think that's the key. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> That's why we did, like, big size pieces. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> So this is definitely a meal all by itself. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> We've loaded it up with lots of veggies. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> Rice is there. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> Just make some raita and meal complete meal. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> It looks good. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> It smells great. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> So join us again on another episode of ShowMeTheCurry.com. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> Adding a pinch of spice to your life.

<time_token_1> <time_token_1> If you are, you've come to the right place. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> Today I'm making a blue cheese stuffed burger <time_token_2> <time_token_3> with a red pepper mayonnaise sauce. <time_token_3> <time_token_3> Sort of like special sauce, but with red peppers. <time_token_3> <time_token_3> It's really delicious. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> I'll get to that in a few minutes. <time_token_4> <time_token_4> But first I'm making my burger mix. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> I'm dividing a piece of blue cheese into eight pieces. <time_token_5> <time_token_5> This could be any kind of cheese that you want. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> Brie would work, cheddar would work, et cetera, et cetera. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> So I've divided my blue cheese into eight pieces. <time_token_7> <time_token_7> You may notice I'm wearing gloves. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> I'm just doing that because blue cheese does have kind of a strong scent. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> And if you are concerned about that on your hands, wear a pair of gloves. <time_token_9> <time_token_9> Also I'm going to be touching meat and then I won't have to wash my hands. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> Here I have three pounds of meat. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> It's ground chuck. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> To that I'm going to add a tablespoon of coarse salt. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> If you're using fine salt or if you're using a particularly salty brand of coarse salt, <time_token_12> <time_token_12> use a teaspoon and a half to two teaspoons. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> I'm also going to season the meat with a teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Normally when I'm making burgers, I don't season the meat at all, <time_token_14> <time_token_14> except for with salt and pepper as I'm cooking it. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> So this one's a little bit special because I actually am putting flavoring right in the burger. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Now add two tablespoons plus two teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> World's hardest word to say. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Very delicious, great depth of flavor, umami. <time_token_18> <time_token_19> What we're doing is giving our burgers a little bit of a steakhouse flavor <time_token_19> <time_token_20> because A1 has a flavor that's sort of similar to Worcestershire, right? <time_token_20> <time_token_20> So that's what we're doing with the blue cheese, etc. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> You get the best. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Two tablespoons plus two teaspoons and then mix everything together. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> You don't want to overwork your meat, <time_token_22> <time_token_23> which is one of the reasons why I generally don't add seasonings to my burgers. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> But sometimes it's just nice to have that flavor right inside, right? <time_token_24> <time_token_25> You want to fancy it up sometimes. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> This is your fancy but easy burger. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Mix it all together. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> Make sure that all the seasonings are well distributed throughout your meat. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> Then divide your meat into eight mounds. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> This is enough for eight burgers. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> You want to make sure that they're sort of evenly divided <time_token_29> <time_token_29> before you pat them into your burgers. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> So do the dividing first. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> Once you're satisfied that your mixture is evenly divided between all your burgers, <time_token_31> <time_token_31> what you want to do is just shape them into your burger shape <time_token_31> <time_token_32> and then make a well in the center, <time_token_32> <time_token_32> which is where you're going to add your blue cheese. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> So make a little hole slash well and just take a piece of blue cheese <time_token_34> <time_token_34> and put it into the center. <time_token_35> <time_token_35> Tuck it in, fold it over, pat it down. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> No one will ever know. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> Make sure it's nice and well enclosed. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Otherwise, as you're cooking it, the cheese could come out. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> You might want to give people a choice of blue cheese and cheddar or mozzarella. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> So make a variety of different cheeses <time_token_39> <time_token_39> and then offer your friends and guests and family a choice. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> If you want to make these ahead, just keep them in a single layer on a baking sheet. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Cover with plastic in the refrigerator. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> You can do it in the morning. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> Probably do it the day ahead. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> I've never done that, but you could definitely do it the morning ahead. <time_token_42> <time_token_43> And nice, firm, chilled burgers are really easy to grill. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Excellent. All done. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> Gloves off to the grill. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Make sure that your grill is preheated, nice and hot, nice and clean, <time_token_46> <time_token_46> and give it a little brush with oil. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Just for safety's sake, there's quite a bit of fat in ground chalk, <time_token_47> <time_token_48> but you never know. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> Just be safe, be careful. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> As you can see, I'm brushing with a handheld piece of paper towel. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Maybe not the best idea, but hey, I'm a crazy girl. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> Place the burgers on the grill. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> You don't need to season them. They're already seasoned, so don't worry about that. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> And cook them about four to six minutes per side. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> While your burgers are cooking, you can get your special sauce ready. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Am I allowed to say special sauce? Maybe not. I don't know. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> I don't care. I said it anyway. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> You're gonna make your sauce right here in this food processor. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> A cup of mayonnaise. Light work fine. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> A quarter cup of chopped roasted red peppers. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Half a teaspoon of white wine vinegar. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> Basically like a little more than a splash of white wine vinegar. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> And about an eighth of a teaspoon of pepper. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Freshly ground if you have it. Regular old pepper if you don't. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> And then just process that up just until it combines. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> And you have your sauce. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> And that's it. That's all there is to the sauce. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Your ultra special, extra fancy, and yet very easy burger. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> It's time to flip the burgers now, so let me go over there. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> Get rid of this. I don't need it anymore. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> Time to flip. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> When they're ready to flip, they should be nice and charred <time_token_66> <time_token_66> and easy to lift off of the grill. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> If you try to flip them too soon, they'll stick. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Don't go too early. I don't feel like I've completely mastered <time_token_68> <time_token_68> the art of hamburger flipping. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Are tongs a better tool? Is a spatula a better tool? <time_token_69> <time_token_69> I don't know. Maybe I should try tongs. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> Oh, yeah. It's better. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> These should be cleaned up. Make sure you have clean tongs. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Not the ones that you use for your raw meat. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> All right. Three to four more minutes. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> I'm going to slice some tomatoes up. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Slice up a tomato or two. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Make sure your knife is nice and sharp. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Serrated knives also work really well for tomatoes. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Spread some of your homemade special sauce on one side of each bun. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> And then if you want a little bit of mustard, why not? <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Combination of spicy and a little bit sweet, really nice. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I mean, obviously, use whatever condiments appeal to you. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> This is just... This is where I'm going today, guys. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> Slice of tomato. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> These are so big, you really only need one. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Don't those look like flowers? They're so cute. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> And then a little bit of greens. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> I'm using baby spinach today, but obviously, <time_token_83> <time_token_83> use whatever you have on hand or whatever appeals to you. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> This is to continue your steakhouse theme <time_token_84> <time_token_84> of the blue cheese and the spinach. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> Now you get cream, spinach at the steakhouse. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> And now you're all ready. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> All you have to do is get your burgers off the grill, <time_token_86> <time_token_86> and I think mine are ready. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> One burger. Yummy. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Cheese stuffers are good. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> Top them off. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> That is insane. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Look how crazily delicious that looks. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> Look at that. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Those are so deluxe, so fantastic, and really so easy. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> You should definitely make them for your next barbecue.

I'm using a lot of potatoes because I am making a big batch <time_token_6> <time_token_7> of these so you can use as many as you want. In a mixing bowl you can start off <time_token_7> <time_token_10> by putting two and a half cups of all-purpose flour. Along with the flour <time_token_10> <time_token_13> you can also add one tablespoon of cumin seed. Saw is literally the preference of <time_token_13> <time_token_14> the person but we've added two teaspoons of saw in this. Then we're also adding a <time_token_14> <time_token_15> quarter cup of oil. As of right now you want to go ahead and start mixing and <time_token_15> <time_token_17> you want to mix all of the oils and everything to the point where if you <time_token_17> <time_token_19> were to mush it in your hands you'd start to get chunks in them. We need the <time_token_19> <time_token_21> dough to be hard and not soft so we're slowly adding water to what we want to <time_token_21> <time_token_22> do with it. Once all of the flour has been just combined together you want to <time_token_22> <time_token_24> go ahead and start kneading this on a counter just so you can break everything <time_token_24> <time_token_25> down completely and mix everything in your hands. And this is how the <time_token_25> <time_token_27> consistency should look. If you can get a wet cloth and just place it on top of <time_token_27> <time_token_28> that it'll be great because that's gonna avoid it from getting hard at the top. <time_token_29> <time_token_33> Now for the filling you're gonna need salt, cumin seed, and red chili pepper. The <time_token_33> <time_token_35> other ingredients you'll need are freshly chopped cilantro, freshly chopped <time_token_35> <time_token_39> mint, and you're gonna need some green chili peppers. All of these vegetables <time_token_39> <time_token_40> came from a frozen pack. You can pick these up at your local grocery store and <time_token_40> <time_token_42> they're very inexpensive so I'm gonna be using green beans, carrots, and peas. Then <time_token_42> <time_token_43> you want to go ahead and start mashing all your potatoes up but try to keep <time_token_43> <time_token_44> them to the point where you'd have chunks in them. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Now in a frying pan you want to use quarter cup of oil and then you want to <time_token_47> <time_token_48> drop in all of your cumin seed and let it fry up. On top of that you're gonna <time_token_48> <time_token_50> add in all of the vegetables and just stir them around for about five minutes. <time_token_53> <time_token_56> Once your frozen vegetables are ready you can go ahead and add them into the <time_token_56> <time_token_58> mixing bowl with the potatoes. Add in your pepper, your salt, and the freshly <time_token_58> <time_token_58> chopped up herbs. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Mix everything very well because you want all of the flavors to be <time_token_61> <time_token_63> distributed evenly throughout the samosas. To start with the wrap of the <time_token_63> <time_token_65> samosa we're gonna be rolling our dough into little golf-sized balls and then <time_token_65> <time_token_66> we're gonna flatten them out to the texture and the softness and the <time_token_66> <time_token_69> flatness and everything to the size of a tortilla. Keep rolling until the dough <time_token_69> <time_token_69> becomes really really flat. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> If your wrap isn't perfect you can go ahead and just cut off the edges to make <time_token_72> <time_token_74> it a circle and then cut it in half so you have a half of a circle and then you <time_token_74> <time_token_75> want to put water around the straight edge and fold them together into a <time_token_75> <time_token_77> little triangle. Make sure you place one flap over the other and then you want to <time_token_77> <time_token_78> press against the flap so when you deep fry them they won't open up and all of <time_token_78> <time_token_79> the vegetables won't come out of it so press as hard as you can so they <time_token_79> <time_token_81> completely stick together. Then you're left with this cone. Start filling that <time_token_81> <time_token_82> in with the potato mix. Using water again we're gonna be applying that on the rim <time_token_82> <time_token_84> of the samosa and then we're gonna close them together. Grabbing one end of <time_token_84> <time_token_85> the samosa and bringing it forward to the edges that were connected to the <time_token_85> <time_token_86> flaps that were connected. You want to keep that side on the front and then <time_token_86> <time_token_88> just close the back of it towards the front and then just press against the <time_token_88> <time_token_91> bottom and you've made a samosa. Now deep frying is pretty typical you just <time_token_91> <time_token_93> turn on the stove and let the oil heat up and then just deep fry it and there <time_token_93> <time_token_95> you go that's your samosa.

Hi I'm Jennifer Wright your Fit Foodie. I'm <time_token_2> <time_token_4> so excited to share with you today an amazing salad that's perfect for spring <time_token_4> <time_token_5> or summer. It's called a fatouche salad also known as a Lebanese peasant salad. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> So easy so fun to make. Starting out with just taking one cucumber chop it up <time_token_7> <time_token_9> really small put it in your bowl then we have a yellow pepper you could use <time_token_9> <time_token_10> red or orange whatever flavor you like and then really pretty tomatoes. I like <time_token_10> <time_token_13> the blend of the yellow the red the orange a few green onions you can also <time_token_13> <time_token_14> use red onions if you prefer the prefer the red onions and then the most <time_token_14> <time_token_16> important ingredient for the salad portion itself is fresh herbs. Today we <time_token_16> <time_token_17> have a mixture of parsley and mint. You always have to use mint to make it a <time_token_17> <time_token_18> fatouche salad but you can add in cilantro and some other herbs if you <time_token_18> <time_token_19> prefer to do that instead of the parsley and one of the little tips that I <time_token_19> <time_token_21> learned recently that I really like is how to cut herbs so they don't get too <time_token_21> <time_token_22> wilty on you. So we have some really pretty mint today and some really pretty <time_token_22> <time_token_23> parsley. I'm just gonna grab them both together. This is called a sundial <time_token_23> <time_token_26> technique. You just chop up your herbs and then once you get a nice chop we're <time_token_26> <time_token_27> just gonna sundial. So take your knife just like a sundial and go back and <time_token_27> <time_token_29> forth and it gives you that really nice chopped herb without getting wilty and <time_token_29> <time_token_31> that's great. So mint is one of those herbs that can take a while to get used <time_token_31> <time_token_32> to. So start out with a small amount of mint let your taste buds get used to it <time_token_32> <time_token_33> and soon enough you will find that you absolutely love the flavor of mint. So <time_token_33> <time_token_34> we're gonna mix this around. My parents, my grandparents actually farmed <time_token_34> <time_token_36> fresh mint when I was young so I've always loved the smell of it and love <time_token_36> <time_token_38> working with it so I hope you do too. So we've got our salad and now for the <time_token_38> <time_token_40> vinaigrette. We're gonna take fresh lemon juice, a lot of it and it's really <time_token_40> <time_token_41> healthy for our body. It helps create an alkaline existence and a little bit of <time_token_41> <time_token_43> olive oil. We're gonna pour that in. Some fresh garlic has to be fresh. It can't be <time_token_43> <time_token_46> the powdered. A little salt and pepper and then our star ingredient is called <time_token_46> <time_token_47> fresh sumac. It's this brilliant, it kind of reminds me of like the Arizona clay <time_token_47> <time_token_49> color. It's this brilliant clay colored spice. It's a dried berry from the <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Mediterranean. They dry it down and they crush it into the spice called sumac. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> It's really good for digestion and it's loaded down with antioxidants so it's <time_token_51> <time_token_53> really great for you. It's known as a spice in the Mediterranean and Greece <time_token_53> <time_token_54> and Turkey and Lebanon. It's not something that we use a lot around here <time_token_54> <time_token_55> but it's something that we should. You can replace your table salt and pepper <time_token_55> <time_token_56> with sumac for some really great flavor and it has a little bit of a citrus <time_token_56> <time_token_58> zest to it so it also goes great with your vinaigrette's. So we're gonna mix <time_token_58> <time_token_60> all these things together and then we're going to pour the salad dressing. <time_token_60> <time_token_63> Actually half of it. Half of it gets poured over the salad. Get messy, have fun <time_token_63> <time_token_65> with it. This part of fun is cooking with your hands. It smells delicious. It's fresh <time_token_65> <time_token_66> lemon with that sumac mixed in. If you're a lemon person you will love this <time_token_66> <time_token_67> recipe. So good with that fresh mint. And then we're gonna throw in some <time_token_67> <time_token_69> pita chips. So I have a whole wheat pita chip that you just toast in your oven. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> You can also buy them in a bag. Many places sell them and then once you <time_token_70> <time_token_72> throw in the pita chip you want to take the reserved dressing and pour over the <time_token_72> <time_token_73> pita chip itself. So I think this may be why it's called a peasant salad. They <time_token_73> <time_token_75> would use day-old bread and make it into the salad to create a little bit <time_token_75> <time_token_76> more substance with the salad itself. So you want to allow the pita chips to <time_token_76> <time_token_78> kind of soaked in with this really yummy sumac vinaigrette and then from there <time_token_78> <time_token_80> we simply plate it on a really pretty plate like this. And I love white plates <time_token_80> <time_token_82> for summer with really fresh ingredients and we're gonna take a bite of this <time_token_82> <time_token_85> really yummy salad. It is so good and it is so fresh. One of the things I'd like <time_token_85> <time_token_86> to point out about sumac is this is not a spice that you can buy at any grocery <time_token_86> <time_token_87> store. The Great American Spice Company is the place that you have to go to get <time_token_87> <time_token_89> it if you want to find the sumac. So you can simply go to GreatAmericanSpice.com <time_token_89> <time_token_90> and pick up the spice online for a flat rate of shipping of just $5.99. So if <time_token_90> <time_token_92> you also want to get a really good salt and pepper using this recipe flat rate <time_token_92> <time_token_93> shipping all these spices for just $5.99 by going to <time_token_93> <time_token_95> AmericanSpice.com.

And today <time_token_4> <time_token_6> I am going to show you how to make Spring Rolls. These are light and refreshing with <time_token_6> <time_token_7> an exotic flavour. So without further delay, let me tell you what you will need for this. <time_token_7> <time_token_10> For the filling you will need half red bell pepper, thinly sliced, 1 carrot grated or <time_token_10> <time_token_13> julienne, half a cup bean sprouts, 1 fourth cup cabbage shredded, half an onion finely <time_token_13> <time_token_17> sliced, half a teaspoon fresh ginger, half a teaspoon garlic grated, 1 fourth cup thin <time_token_17> <time_token_20> noodles pre-cooked, you can use rice or Chinese noodles, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, salt to <time_token_20> <time_token_23> taste, half a tablespoon of oyster sauce, 1 teaspoon of sugar, half a teaspoon of pepper, <time_token_23> <time_token_26> corn flour, 1 tablespoon, some water to make a paste and half a litre vegetable oil. And <time_token_26> <time_token_29> store bought spring roll sheets. So I am going to heat some oil in a wok. I am going to let <time_token_29> <time_token_32> it heat up a little bit. To this I am going to add the onions, ginger and the garlic. <time_token_34> <time_token_38> And then to this we will add our red bell pepper, carrots, bean sprouts and the cabbage. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> We want to cook till they are slightly tender. We need them a little crunchy. Cover and cook <time_token_42> <time_token_44> for about 2 minutes till their vegetables are slightly softened and the flavours have <time_token_44> <time_token_46> a chance to intermingle. You can see that they have become slightly tender. Just dry <time_token_46> <time_token_48> up the little liquid that may have been released by the cabbage. And now I am going to finish <time_token_48> <time_token_53> this off by adding some sugar, salt, pepper, soy sauce, oyster sauce, give it a good stir. <time_token_53> <time_token_56> And now to this I am going to add the noodles. Now this is done and I am going to just let <time_token_56> <time_token_58> it cool for a while. So the vegetables have now cooled off. I have heated some oil in <time_token_58> <time_token_62> a pan and I am going to make a paste with corn flour and water. I am going to keep it <time_token_62> <time_token_64> aside. And now I am going to take a spring roll wrapper and I am going to place it in <time_token_64> <time_token_65> front of me so that it looks like a diamond. The rest of them I am covering with a damp <time_token_65> <time_token_68> cloth. Now to this we are going to add a little bit of our vegetable mixture. I am going to <time_token_68> <time_token_71> place it like this. Then you keep folding it and when you reach here you take it in <time_token_72> <time_token_76> like this. Then with a brush put some contour paste on the side like this and cover it up <time_token_76> <time_token_80> like this to make it into a cylinder and also it seals up the corner. So now once all of <time_token_80> <time_token_83> them are folded I am going to deep fry them in the hot oil. I am going to deep fry them <time_token_83> <time_token_84> till they are golden brown and crisp on all sides. <time_token_85> <time_token_88> Three spring rolls served with sweet and sour sauce. A great appetizer for any occasion. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Don't forget to try this recipe and let me know how it turned out in the comments section <time_token_89> <time_token_91> below.

They're red-skinned potatoes, <time_token_56> <time_token_57> and I cut them into quarters, <time_token_57> <time_token_58> and I steamed them until they're just tender <time_token_58> <time_token_60> so I can poke my fork in nice and easy, <time_token_60> <time_token_61> but they're not going to smush up. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> That's exactly how they like them. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> Now, I'm going to take my tender, steamed potatoes, <time_token_65> <time_token_66> add them to the pot, <time_token_68> <time_token_70> and then all I'm going to do is mash it up a little bit. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> You can use your hand potato masher <time_token_71> <time_token_74> or you can use a big fork and just mash up the potatoes. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> Now, this is not smooth, creamy mashed potatoes. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> This is a lot more rustic, <time_token_77> <time_token_78> so you'll have just nice pieces of potato <time_token_78> <time_token_80> with the red skin showing, the browned cabbage. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> Mmm, it's delicious, <time_token_82> <time_token_83> and it goes perfect with your corned beef <time_token_83> <time_token_84> if that's what you'd like to have for St. Patrick's Day. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> There, that looks perfect. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> Now I'm just going to stir it up. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> I'll add a little bit of salt and pepper. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> Give it a little taste. <time_token_91> <time_token_93> Mmm, it's perfect. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Now you're all set for St. Patrick's Day. <time_token_95> <time_token_97> I'm Sue Doden, sharing good food for good life, 365.

Well, everybody loves buffalo wings, party wings, hot wings. <time_token_1> <time_token_2> They're so popular now that they're actually more expensive than boneless, skinless chicken <time_token_2> <time_token_3> breasts and that's why you see boneless, skinless wings at a lot of places. <time_token_3> <time_token_5> All the bars and restaurants and fast food places are selling chicken wings and they <time_token_5> <time_token_6> have become one of the most expensive parts of the chicken. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> Obviously, you've heard me before, I'm going to tell you, go to Costco, they're the cheapest <time_token_7> <time_token_8> Interestingly, you may find frozen wings in the bag, uncooked but broken down and completely <time_token_8> <time_token_10> ready for you to cook for less expensive than the fresh wings which is interesting <time_token_10> <time_token_11> because usually the more processed something is, the more expensive it is. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> In this case, we found a great deal on the whole uncooked wings and the first thing you <time_token_12> <time_token_13> need to do is take these things apart. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> So it's really pretty easy. <time_token_13> <time_token_15> One cut down by the skin, pop it open and you can see the joint and then straight through <time_token_15> <time_token_15> the joint you're never ever cutting through bone. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> The wingtip, same thing, here you do sort of have to go right through it. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> Leave those wingtips for soup. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> They are very, very valuable. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> Okay, so there I've got the wings. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> That was about 15 of them that I cut up. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Sort of laborious and a bit of a pain but it's always better if you do this stuff yourself. <time_token_21> <time_token_21> Now we're going to season them and here's the thing. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> We're not going to deep fry these the way traditional buffalo wings are. <time_token_22> <time_token_24> Those are the best and there's no denying that's the way to do them but a lot of people <time_token_24> <time_token_24> don't have deep fryers. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> We're going to try to do these in the oven. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> The problem with doing them in the oven is they don't get crisp. <time_token_25> <time_token_27> Now if you read around the internet and all those other cool places where they have recipes, <time_token_27> <time_token_27> they've come up with a way to keep these things crispy in the oven. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> We're going to test it out and see if it works. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> So first we need to make a seasoning mix and for the seasoning mix, I'm going to make, <time_token_30> <time_token_32> I'm going to use a couple of tablespoons of my seasoned salt mix which again, as I've <time_token_32> <time_token_32> said before, the recipe is on the web. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> If you don't feel like making it yourself, we'll be happy to sell you some. <time_token_33> <time_token_36> Couple of tablespoons of the pepper and instead of a lot of other seasonings, they tell you <time_token_36> <time_token_38> to put baking powder because baking powder they say crisps up the wings. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> I don't know if it does but we're going to add about two tablespoons to the mix and mix <time_token_43> <time_token_43> it up thoroughly <time_token_45> <time_token_45> and really get it into the wings. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> We're going to sort of rub it in. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> So all the wings are thoroughly coated with this mixture. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> It looks fantastic but there's one more thing we need to do before we make them. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> This is why I hope you're not watching this the morning of Super Bowl Sunday. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> These things have to sit and dry in the refrigerator for a day. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> That's going to help keep the skin very, very crispy. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> We're going to set them out on a tray, put them in the fridge and let them dry overnight. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Well, as you can see, the wings have been drying overnight. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> They've got a nice dry texture. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> The skin has dried out a lot. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> We rubbed them with the seasonings and the baking powder to make them get crispy, at least in theory. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> And now we're going to put them in a 400 degree oven. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Total cooking time is going to be probably about 45 minutes. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> But I'm going to check them after about 20, 25 minutes and flip them over. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> The other thing to know is that I put the oven rack all the way up as high as it will go <time_token_62> <time_token_63> so that I can get a lot of radiated heat from the top of the oven <time_token_63> <time_token_64> so it's almost more like a broiler. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> We'll see if that works. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> So now, into the oven for the first 25 minutes. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> I've got these out of the oven now and they're actually turning a rather nice color. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> I'm going to flip them all over so they get a chance to sort of baste themselves <time_token_68> <time_token_69> with whatever fat they have under the skin that's rendering out. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> Now, these may stick a little bit. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Just move them a little bit on the rack and they should come off fairly easy. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Well, I will say they look pretty good and they're smelling really, really good. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> But now, back into the oven for another 20, 25 minutes. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Well, it's been about 25 extra minutes. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> I've got to say, these things look really, really good. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> They're not tremendously dark in color but they do have a very firm, crispy feeling skin. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> So I think we may have accomplished our goal of getting crispy wings out of the oven instead of deep frying them. <time_token_79> <time_token_81> I have here the most typical brand of hot sauce that's used for these wings. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> It's probably the most authentic. <time_token_82> <time_token_84> And I have about, in this little cup I have, about a quarter cup of melted butter <time_token_84> <time_token_85> to which I'm going to add about a half a cup of hot sauce. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> I've got a nice big bowl here. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> I'm going to put my sauce into it. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> And I'm not going to sauce all the wings because the boys are going to come home and they're not going to want sauce probably. <time_token_89> <time_token_92> But let's take, I don't know, a dozen and a half or so and just shake them through the sauce. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> You can hear how crispy they are. <time_token_93> <time_token_98> There you have it, some very crispy, very tasty, oven fried buffalo wings.

"<time_token_3> <time_token_3> Hello and welcome to Nyonya Cooking! <time_token_3> <time_token_5> If you've watched my previous videos, I've prepared pickled green chilli, <time_token_5> <time_token_7> BBQ pork which is also known as char siu and also wonton soup <time_token_7> <time_token_8> The next video, the next recipe has to come <time_token_8> <time_token_9> This is wonton noodles <time_token_9> <time_token_10> So, we have two different kinds of wonton noodles in Malaysia <time_token_10> <time_token_11> One is a dry version and the other is the soup version <time_token_11> <time_token_12> So, the soup version is basically wonton soup <time_token_12> <time_token_13> You just add the noodles into the soup <time_token_13> <time_token_14> As for the dry version, I'm going to show you how to prepare this <time_token_14> <time_token_15> and to assemble everything <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Together with your char siu, pick a green chilli and of course the wonton <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Because without wonton, it will not be wonton noodles <time_token_17> <time_token_18> So, let's get started and look at the ingredients <time_token_18> <time_token_19> To prepare the sauce of the noodles, we'll need these ingredients <time_token_19> <time_token_20> So, I have a bit of salt and sugar just for taste <time_token_20> <time_token_22> Then, two cloves of garlic which I've just chopped roughly <time_token_22> <time_token_23> Two tablespoons of oil <time_token_23> <time_token_23> Two tablespoons of dark soy sauce <time_token_24> <time_token_25> One teaspoon of light soy sauce <time_token_25> <time_token_26> One teaspoon of ketchup mayonnaise <time_token_26> <time_token_26> Also, one teaspoon of sesame oil <time_token_27> <time_token_27> Those were the ingredients for the sauce <time_token_27> <time_token_29> As for the noodles, I've baked some egg noodles <time_token_29> <time_token_29> These are fresh <time_token_29> <time_token_30> So, I found this at the Asian market <time_token_30> <time_token_31> It's not always that we get these kinds of noodles <time_token_31> <time_token_32> These are freshly made and they cannot be kept for so many days <time_token_32> <time_token_33> To add some greeneries to your noodles, I'm using choy sum <time_token_33> <time_token_34> There are always these little yellow flowers on it <time_token_34> <time_token_35> So, those are the ones that you're looking for <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Of course, you can also replace it with a baby duck choy if you want <time_token_36> <time_token_37> For this dish, usually we use choy sum <time_token_37> <time_token_38> We will first work with the garlic first <time_token_38> <time_token_39> This is where we are going to prepare the garlic oil <time_token_39> <time_token_40> So, pour the oil into the hot wok <time_token_40> <time_token_40> Then, add the garlic in <time_token_40> <time_token_42> All we want is just oil infused with garlic <time_token_43> <time_token_43> So, using the same wok, do not need to clean it <time_token_44> <time_token_44> I'm just going to add water <time_token_45> <time_token_46> This is supposed to boil <time_token_46> <time_token_47> This is where we are going to add the vegetables in <time_token_47> <time_token_49> So, just add in the stems because they take longer to cook <time_token_49> <time_token_50> 20 seconds later, you can add the vegetables <time_token_50> <time_token_50> So, put everything in <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Vegetables do not take long to cook <time_token_51> <time_token_52> So, you just need to just blanch them with hot water <time_token_52> <time_token_53> As you see now, the colour has changed a little <time_token_53> <time_token_54> It's slightly darker green <time_token_54> <time_token_55> The next step that we are going to do is to cook the noodles <time_token_56> <time_token_57> So, while this is cooking for 2 minutes, I'm just going to add all the dark soy sauce <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Some sesame oil <time_token_59> <time_token_60> And ketchup mummies <time_token_60> <time_token_61> 1 tbsp of water <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Because all the sauces are slightly thick <time_token_62> <time_token_63> So, you would want everything to be watery <time_token_63> <time_token_64> That's why we added sauce water <time_token_65> <time_token_65> And some salt and sugar <time_token_65> <time_token_66> So, put the sauce on low heat <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Earlier, we prepared some garlic oil <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Pour the garlic oil in it <time_token_68> <time_token_69> You wouldn't want the garlic pieces, just the oil <time_token_69> <time_token_69> And then, give it a good stir <time_token_70> <time_token_70> This is where we're just going to add the noodles in it <time_token_73> <time_token_73> It goes on to the plate again <time_token_73> <time_token_75> This time, it's when we assemble everything <time_token_75> <time_token_76> After setting your vegetables, you would of course need to have your char siu on top of it <time_token_77> <time_token_78> 1 ton noodles will not be complete without 1 ton soup <time_token_78> <time_token_79> When we have 1 ton noodles in Malaysia, <time_token_79> <time_token_80> we must have pickled green chilli

Perfect for that this father's day. For this recipe I am using bone in chicken <time_token_8> <time_token_10> pieces about 1 kg. It's your choice, you can remove the skin, remove the fat or use them <time_token_10> <time_token_14> with it. I am gonna remove it. So once the fat and the skin has been removed, set your <time_token_14> <time_token_17> chicken pieces aside and in a wok, go ahead and add 2-3 tbsp of oil and in hot oil go <time_token_17> <time_token_20> ahead and add 1 tsp of cumin seeds. In these sizzling seeds we are adding 1 large chopped <time_token_20> <time_token_24> onion and we are going to fry onion with the cumin seeds with ginger garlic paste and <time_token_24> <time_token_30> some spices. So along with onions 1 tbsp of ginger garlic paste, homemade and seasoning <time_token_30> <time_token_33> so salt should be as per taste. I think 1 tsp should be sufficient. Half a tsp of turmeric <time_token_34> <time_token_38> called haldi and dried red chillies too. I am just gonna crush them with my hand and <time_token_38> <time_token_42> put them in. But if you want a milder curry you can skip this step and you can also use <time_token_42> <time_token_45> green chillies instead of dried red chillies. So mixing all the components together fry <time_token_45> <time_token_48> for 3-4 minutes and then go ahead and add your chicken. We are going to coat the chicken <time_token_48> <time_token_54> with this masala. Mix it well together. Let it seal. Let it turn white. So mixing everything <time_token_54> <time_token_59> well together and then we are gonna add a little bit of curry powder or 1 tsp. This <time_token_59> <time_token_62> is fresh homemade blend but you can also use store bought. For a spicier version you can <time_token_62> <time_token_66> use madras curry powder. So curry powder is in. All dhabas usually have their own version. <time_token_66> <time_token_69> So make your own blend and add it in and 1 tbsp of tomato paste gives nice red color <time_token_69> <time_token_74> to the curry. So mixing the powder, tomato paste, mixing all the ingredients and then <time_token_74> <time_token_77> adding 1 cup to 2 cups of water depending on how thick or thin you want your curry to <time_token_77> <time_token_80> be. So mix the water well with other components and then let everything come in together. <time_token_80> <time_token_83> Let your chicken cook. Let it simmer. Once your chicken is ready after about 15-20 minutes <time_token_83> <time_token_88> you can cut in and check it should not be pink in the middle. So garnish it with cilantro <time_token_88> <time_token_92> leaves and serve this delicious spicy chicken curry with rice, with naan, with paratha, <time_token_92> <time_token_95> with flatbread of your choice.

it just like that but I <time_token_31> <time_token_32> prefer it like this on top of this just put some salsa this is what is going to <time_token_32> <time_token_35> give a nice fresh salad effect and of course some gochamole, some gochamole <time_token_35> <time_token_37> wow look at this and nothing like a spoonful of sour cream that's it and <time_token_37> <time_token_39> there's a simple technique in making the fold also just fold it like this and <time_token_39> <time_token_41> then bring it up like just fold it in the center then again one more fold like <time_token_41> <time_token_44> this that way it will get folded nicely and now press it and then squeeze it back <time_token_44> <time_token_46> that way it will be rolled perfectly and you'll be able to make your

want you can also top it <time_token_52> <time_token_54> off with some cheese any cheese will do that should be good enough <time_token_54> <time_token_56> now look at the folding technique just fold it in the center like this then lift <time_token_56> <time_token_58> this up and now again because this you don't want the bottom one to go up <time_token_58> <time_token_60> that's why fold it little bit in then put the top one and then squeeze it back <time_token_60> <time_token_62> this way all the stuffing will go inside and then you will be able to roll it <time_token_62> <time_token_64>

So let's check out the ingredients quickly. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> I have here one tablespoon of scallions of green onions, half tablespoon of ginger, <time_token_8> <time_token_10> quarter tablespoon of garlic, they should be very finely chopped, quarter cup of carrots, <time_token_10> <time_token_11> quarter cup of green bell peppers or capsicum, quarter cup of bok choy, a little less than quarter <time_token_11> <time_token_14> cup of broccoli, some freshly chopped cilantro, one-eighth cup of peanuts, soy sauce, sesame oil. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Now I will be using almost half tablespoon of soy sauce and half tablespoon of sesame oil <time_token_15> <time_token_17> to get the vegetables fried. Pot sticker wrappers, now these are eggless pot sticker wrappers, <time_token_17> <time_token_18> stove pot, some black pepper, half teaspoon of black pepper here, salt, some water to seal <time_token_18> <time_token_20> the ends of the pot sticker and some refined oil, sunflower oil here to fry the pot stickers. So <time_token_20> <time_token_22> that's it. Quite a few ingredients but very easy preparation. So let's make pot stickers. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> I have an all-stick skillet heating up with half tablespoon of sesame oil. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> In goes scallions, ginger and garlic. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> Give it a quick sauce. I'm just going to dump in all my vegetables. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> You can use roughly chopped onions, cabbage, you can use any vegetable that you like. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> I just take the beef, add some salt. We're going to add the soy sauce so make sure <time_token_32> <time_token_34> you keep in mind that soy sauce has salt and add salt accordingly. Dump in your black pepper, <time_token_34> <time_token_35> half teaspoon of black pepper here, half tablespoon of soy sauce. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> That's it. I don't want to cook the vegetables through. I still want crunchy vegetables. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> So I'm going to switch off my stove here and transfer this to a bowl. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> So these are my sauteed vegetables. They've been sauteed in sesame oil and soy sauce with <time_token_40> <time_token_41> some black pepper and salt. Simple. Now I'm going to mix in these peanuts <time_token_42> <time_token_42> and the freshly chopped cilantro. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> That's it. Give it a quick toss. The peanuts give a good crunchiness to your pork stickers. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> That's the reason why I've added peanuts here and the cilantro gives a very fresh feeling. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> That's it. Give a quick taste test just to make sure salt is right. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Salt is perfect. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> So now I'm going to make the pork stickers. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> Take one wrapper. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> Make sure you have some water close by. Now <time_token_54> <time_token_55> add a spoonful of vegetables with some peanuts. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Tip your index finger in water and apply it in the border. <time_token_57> <time_token_60> Now just fold it after folding it. The water helps seal it. Very simple. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> That's it. Give it a press. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> Give it a press. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> Press and press. That's a simple pork sticker or a dumpling. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> So from the quantities mentioned, I have got 11 pork stickers wrapped with the vegetables. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> The next step is going to be frying the pork stickers. So I have a nonstick skillet heating <time_token_67> <time_token_68> up with 2 tablespoons of refined oil, sunflower oil here. Once the oil gets hot, <time_token_68> <time_token_69> I'm going to arrange the pork stickers in the pan without overcrowding the pan. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Oil is hot. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> It's been 2 minutes now. Let's check if the bottom has turned crispy. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Oh yeah, this is what I want. It has turned golden and crispy. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Without wasting any time, add quarter cup of water. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> Close it with a lid. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> Let the steam cook the rest of the pork sticker. Let's check back when the water evaporates. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> I can see that it has become really transparent, which means it is cooked. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> I'm just freezing for the entire water to evaporate and the bottom part to turn really crispy. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> So my veg pork sticker and the dipping sauce is here already. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> The pork stickers just took 5-6 minutes. It took up completely. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> Look for the water to evaporate and for the crispy skin to form. I can show you the crispy skin. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> So this is how the bottom of your pork sticker should look. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> See, they are crispy. So I'm going to taste with my dipping sauce. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Now, this is a ginger soy dipping sauce. Very easy dipping sauce. I have posted the recipe <time_token_91> <time_token_93> for this in another video. So do check out ginger soy dipping sauce recipe. I'm going to give it a <time_token_95> <time_token_96> Please don't try this recipe and let me know how it turned out in the comment section below. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> Try watching my channel if you really really like it.

this week I'm sharing a dish that will please even the pickiest palates. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> This recipe for stir-fried egg noodles is a favorite among my friends and colleagues <time_token_6> <time_token_7> and often requested for our get-togethers. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> When cooking for a group, keep in mind meat preferences and food allergies. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> This recipe can be easily adjusted to accommodate these needs. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> Here's what we need to make this dish. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> Thin egg noodles, garlic, carrots, celery, onion, bok choy, soy sauce, oyster sauce, <time_token_12> <time_token_13> sugar, vegetable oil, and ground black pepper. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> We also need roast pork. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> I shared this video recipe earlier, so please click the link or see my channel for the recipe. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> Feel free to use another meat of your choice, such as chicken, beef, or seafood. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> For vegetarian options, use pan-fried seitan or tofu, or we can omit the meat altogether. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> We start by removing the fresh egg noodles from the packaging. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Now gently unravel and loosen each of the bundles. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Using kitchen shears, cut the strands so they are shorter. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> This will make it easier to cook and eat later. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> Next, bring a large pot of water to a rapid boil. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Pop in the noodles and then swirl around in the hot water for 30 seconds. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> As the noodles are really thin, we don't want to overcook them. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Now we drain the noodles in a large colander. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> We rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> Toss the noodles in the colander and try to remove as much of the water as possible. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Now let's spread out the noodles on several large platters or trays and let them air dry <time_token_33> <time_token_34> for two hours. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> It's important that the noodles are dry before stir frying, otherwise they will be soft and mushy. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> For the roast pork or any meat of your choice, we just need to cut into thin strips. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> Smash the garlic and then remove the skin. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> Now we can finely mince it. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> For the carrots, cut into thin slices. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> I'm cutting at a slight angle. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> And then we cut into thin strips. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> Cut the celery stalk into two inch sections. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> And then again we cut each of the sections into thin strips. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> The onion just needs to be cut into thin slices. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> For the bok choy, separate the leafy part from the stem. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Cut the stem just like we did the celery into thin strips. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> Cut the bok choy leaves in half and then just give them a rough chop. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> The vegetables are prepped and we can continue with the next steps. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> To make the stir fry sauce, let's combine two tablespoons of soy sauce, two tablespoons <time_token_52> <time_token_54> of oyster sauce, and one teaspoon of sugar. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Just give it a quick stir to mix everything together. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Next let's heat a large wok over medium high heat and when it's nice and hot, drizzle in <time_token_57> <time_token_57> one tablespoon of vegetable oil. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Swirl the wok slightly to evenly coat it with the oil. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Now add the minced garlic and quickly stir fry for 10 seconds. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Add the carrots and stir fry for 1 minute. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Next add the celery and again stir fry for 1 minute. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> Add the onions and bok choy stems and stir fry for 1 minute. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> Let's add the bok choy leaves now and toss everything together. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Stir fry for about a minute until the leaves are wilted. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> Now turn off the heat. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> Add 2 tablespoons of the stir fry sauce and then mix everything together. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Finish by adding some freshly ground black pepper. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> Now scoop out the veggies and place in a clean bowl. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> We will be stir frying these vegetables again so they don't need to be completely cooked <time_token_71> <time_token_71> at this time. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Heat the same wok over medium high heat and add 2 tablespoons of oil. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> Add the noodles making sure to spread them out on the surface of the wok. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> If you have a smaller wok you may need to cook in a few batches. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Try not to stir fry too many noodles at once or they may clump together. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> Stir fry the noodles for about 6 to 7 minutes, tossing and then spreading them out in the <time_token_79> <time_token_79> wok so they don't clump together. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> If the noodles start to stick together drizzle in a little bit more vegetable oil. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Now we can add back the vegetables. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> Add the roast pork or your choice of meat. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> Toss everything together combining all the ingredients. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> Drizzle in the remaining stir fry sauce. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> Add some more black pepper. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Stir fry for another 2 minutes and then we're all finished. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> Enjoy this as a main entree or a side dish. <time_token_92>

The dough will not be completely smooth, but it should be <time_token_27> <time_token_28> easy to shape with a play-doh-like consistency. Next let the dough sit under <time_token_28> <time_token_29> a towel for 30 minutes to an hour. By this point the potatoes should be nice <time_token_29> <time_token_30> and tender, so you're going to drain them and add them to the bowl with some <time_token_30> <time_token_31> cheese and butter. Then you're going to take a fork and start smashing them <time_token_31> <time_token_33> until they are well combined. This is what they should look like when they're <time_token_33> <time_token_34> well combined and you're just going to take that and put it to the side. And now <time_token_34> <time_token_36> for the dough. Now you're just going to flour your surface again and then take <time_token_36> <time_token_37> your dough and divide it into six smaller pieces. Once you divide it into <time_token_37> <time_token_38> six smaller pieces, you're going to roll them out into smaller balls and put them <time_token_38> <time_token_40> under a towel to sit and work with one ball at a time. Roll each individual ball <time_token_40> <time_token_42> out with the rolling pin to about 1 eighth of an inch in thickness, about 10 <time_token_42> <time_token_44> to 11 inches wide. Using a floured three inch round cookie cutter or an inverted <time_token_44> <time_token_44> glass, cut out circles of dough. <time_token_50> <time_token_53> Now you're going to take a little bit of your filling and I decided to add some <time_token_53> <time_token_56> spinach to it last minute. Now you're going to take some water and line the <time_token_56> <time_token_57> edge of the dough with it so that it'll act as a glue and stick together. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Now that you have closed it, just take a fork to press it and seal it together. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Continue that process until you have used the rest of your dough and then once you <time_token_62> <time_token_64> are finished, transfer it onto a plate. In small batches, place your pierogies in the <time_token_64> <time_token_66> water and wait for them to float. Once they float, they are done. I put them on <time_token_66> <time_token_66> the cookie sheet and then put them in the oven to keep them warm. I have it on <time_token_66> <time_token_67> the lowest setting possible. I then layered the marinara sauce with the <time_token_67> <time_token_69> pierogies, kind of like you would with lasagna, and then bake it until the sauce is well <time_token_69> <time_token_70> heated. And this is your results. I hope you enjoyed this recipe.

Welcome to my kitchen. Today I'm going to be making curry yaki udon. <time_token_1> <time_token_3> And it is a Chinese... I think it's a Chinese. I'm not sure. It could be Indian. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> I don't know. That's what it's gonna look like anyways. I'm using these udon <time_token_4> <time_token_6> noodles and I have already cooked them and drained them. I have some bean <time_token_6> <time_token_9> sprouts. I have some ginger. I used the... what did I do with it? I used the crystallized <time_token_9> <time_token_10> ginger. It's soft but it's crystallized. It's got like a... I don't know what it's <time_token_10> <time_token_11> got on it. Like a sugar or something. Yep. It's baby ginger root with cane sugar and <time_token_11> <time_token_13> it's soft enough to cut up. So I cut that up into real small bits. I chopped a <time_token_13> <time_token_15> medium onion. I julienne some carrots. I have my chicken marinating in some <time_token_15> <time_token_17> sesame oil and some low-sodium soy sauce. And I did add a little bit of cracked <time_token_17> <time_token_19> pepper and a tiny touch of salt. So that's all marinated here. And I'm gonna heat up <time_token_19> <time_token_21> my pan here to cook the chicken. I'm going to add a little bit of vegetable <time_token_21> <time_token_22> oil to the pan. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Heat up for a few seconds. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Okay, so now my pan is heated up and I'm going to add my chicken. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> I'm going to saute that until it's not pink in the middle anymore. <time_token_31> <time_token_35> Okay, halfway through the chicken cooking I'm going to add my onion, my ginger, my shredded <time_token_35> <time_token_38> carrots, and my curry powder. And it calls for two tablespoons, but I'm going to add, I'm just gonna <time_token_38> <time_token_39> eyeball it. Probably about two teaspoons instead. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> I'm going to add a teaspoon of minced garlic. <time_token_51> <time_token_51> I'm going to add a little bit of hoisin sauce. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> This is smelling so good, guys. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> I'm going to put in my bean sprouts. <time_token_62> <time_token_65> God, does it smell good. Now I'm going to add my noodles that have been already cooked, my udon noodles. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> I'm going to break it apart like this. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Oh, I wish I had smell-o-vision. This is smelling so good. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> I'm going to turn that down to just barely a flicker of a flame if you have, I don't know, a gas, I mean, a gas cooking. <time_token_88> <time_token_90> I'm just going to cover that and let all of the flavors kind of blend in together and I'll be back in a second and tell you how it tastes. <time_token_90> <time_token_94> I decided to dump in a little bit of water chestnuts, too, just for a little crunch. So I'm just going to stir those in, let them absorb the rest of the flavors, and I'll be back in a little bit. <time_token_96> <time_token_98> That's what it looks like all done, guys, and it came out delicious.

<time_token_1> In order to make pork fried rice, the first and most important thing you're going to need <time_token_2> <time_token_3> Equally important to the pork fried rice process is rice. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> Now we need something to fry it in. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> I'm going to be using soybean oil because that's what I have access to and it's actually <time_token_6> <time_token_7> From here on out, everything is strictly optional. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> You can pick your own veggies. <time_token_8> <time_token_8> You can pick fruit if you want. <time_token_8> <time_token_10> You can mix and match all kinds of things and make it taste however you like. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> Stir fry and fried rice is very much your own choices, whatever you want. <time_token_12> <time_token_15> I chose ginger, garlic, a red pepper, a carrot, and finally, pickled yellow radish. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> It's actually really good. <time_token_16> <time_token_17> It's sort of sour, sort of sweet, sort of bitter. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Alright guys, that's all the stuff you need to make pork fried rice. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Let's go ahead and get started. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> This job is best suited for the GoPro, so I'm actually going to stick with GoPro for <time_token_20> <time_token_20> the rest of these shots. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> This is where all the action happens and this is where things are going to get really good. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> First thing you want to do is take a little bit of oil, just a splash. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> You don't want very much at all. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> This goes for all food, but stir fry definitely. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> The sooner you add something to the pot, the less flavor it's going to have. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> The less impact it's going to have on the overall flavor. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> You're still going to be able to taste things. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> It's just not going to be as strong. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> So if you don't like garlic very much, add the garlic first. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> I have pre-cut all of my vegetables and I'm going to go ahead and toss them here into <time_token_33> <time_token_33> That was really fun actually. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> I enjoyed that a lot. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Guys, when I said this was going to be easy, I meant in a very real way that this is going <time_token_35> <time_token_36> to be very easy. <time_token_36> <time_token_38> You want to be careful not to stop stirring because you should be running this at a very <time_token_38> <time_token_40> high heat and if you stop stirring, you could end up with burns on the bottom of your food <time_token_40> <time_token_40> and you just don't want that. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Also this helps to cook it evenly. <time_token_41> <time_token_44> Now if you're feeling really crazy and you want to get sort of awesome, you can do this <time_token_44> <time_token_46> thing and then spill it all over. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> That was going really well until I looked at the camera. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Alright, so those are nice and warm. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> So I'm going to go ahead and add the garlic now. <time_token_49> <time_token_51> I am adding a fair bit of garlic and I'm doing that because we haven't really had spices <time_token_51> <time_token_51> for our food. <time_token_51> <time_token_54> A ground dried out spice like you're used to finding in the bottles or the jars in the <time_token_54> <time_token_54> states are not super common here. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> So I had to buy a giant package of garlic, which I'm not opposed to, I love garlic. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> I had to buy ginger that I cut up myself, you know, things that are different in Korea. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> One thing you really don't want is burnt garlic. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> So after you add the garlic, don't wait very long before you start adding other ingredients. <time_token_61> <time_token_64> Next up is the pork and I have also, when I cooked this earlier, I put the ginger in <time_token_64> <time_token_66> with it so it would, just so the flavors would combine a little bit and I think it would <time_token_66> <time_token_66> be really good. <time_token_66> <time_token_68> It sat airtight for a while, so all that air, all the flavors from the ginger were <time_token_68> <time_token_69> able to mix in with the pork. <time_token_69> <time_token_69> So I'm actually really excited about this. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> So we're going to go ahead and dump those in. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> I can smell the ginger in and out and it's just absolutely wonderful. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Actually worked out really well. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> I did much better that time. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> I'm coming back to my old friend, the pre-cooked single serving rice container. <time_token_75> <time_token_77> Now this is something I didn't practice before and it is pretty dry. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> It's definitely drier than I thought it was going to be. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> So I'm going to make an audible call here, I'm going to add a little bit of soy sauce <time_token_79> <time_token_80> here on the fly to help moisten up the rice a little bit. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Know that your workstation is going to get dirty when you're doing stir fry, like it's <time_token_82> <time_token_82> just part of it. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> And guys, that's seriously it. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> You just cut up your ingredients, you put them in a wok and you stir it all together <time_token_85> <time_token_86> and over high heat and you have dinner. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> So let's go ahead and put this on a plate and see what it looks like. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> I decided to put it in bowls today and it's super simple just like the whole cooking process <time_token_89> <time_token_91> Just kind of nudged on out of there. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Now one thing that you need to understand that some people missed last week. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> When I cook this food, I eat it. <time_token_94> <time_token_96> This is for an actual meal that myself and my actual wife will be enjoying tonight. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> That fit nicely into two bowls. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> All that's left to do is grab some spoons and dig in. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> Thanks for watching and Joel, I look forward to your video or something.

Great. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> A raw chicken, always want to be careful. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> So I'm using tongs, okay, just to handle the raw chicken, <time_token_21> <time_token_22> and I'll use a completely different set of tongs once I cook it. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> But I'm going to get rid of my plastic wrap and clear my board, okay? <time_token_22> <time_token_23> And then I'm going to show you the standard breading procedure, okay? <time_token_23> <time_token_24> So I have some all-purpose flour, I have a cup of that. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> I have three eggs here that I've really taken my time and whisked them very, very well. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> You want to make sure they're completely broken up and sort of foamy on top. <time_token_26> <time_token_26> That way you're going to get good coverage. <time_token_26> <time_token_27> And then I have some Italian seasoned breadcrumbs that I also added <time_token_27> <time_token_28> some more parmesan reggiano to just to bump that flavor. <time_token_28> <time_token_28> So what I'm going to do is I'm going to season the chicken breasts <time_token_28> <time_token_29> with some sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> All right, we're just building layers of flavor here, <time_token_30> <time_token_30> so obviously we want to make sure this chicken tastes good <time_token_30> <time_token_31> before we get it into the breading. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> And then I've got a pair of tongs here. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> It makes the job a little cleaner, right into the flour. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> And the idea here is to get a nice even coat of everything <time_token_33> <time_token_34> on top of the chicken breast. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> You want to make sure that there's no spot of your chicken breast <time_token_34> <time_token_35> that's not covered with flour because we're building a seal here <time_token_35> <time_token_35> and we're establishing a crust. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> And what we want is to not press it in. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> We just want to make sure it's nicely even coated. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> And if you just get it coated very simply and very easily <time_token_37> <time_token_38> without trying to get too much on there, it's going to be light as a snowflake. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> And that's kind of what you want. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> You want it to be really, really crispy on the outside <time_token_39> <time_token_39> and you don't want that breading caked on. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> So you just want to make sure, even coat all the way through. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> You know, you'll see some people really press it down. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> I don't like to do that. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> I like to just flip it a couple of times, <time_token_42> <time_token_42> cover the areas that are still uncovered <time_token_42> <time_token_43> with all three of these ingredients. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> And there you go. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> You've got a perfectly breaded chicken breast right there, okay? <time_token_44> <time_token_45> So we're just going to do that with all four of these chicken breasts <time_token_45> <time_token_45> and then we're going to saute them in a pan <time_token_45> <time_token_46> so they're golden brown and crispy. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> All right, so I've got my pan here, preheated, medium-high. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> I started with about a half a cup of pure olive oil. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> I want to do these in batches. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> The idea here is to not overcrowd the pan so we get nice, even browning. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Again, we wanted to pound the chicken so it's nice, even thickness. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> We want to get nice, even browning as well. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> The crust to chicken parmesan is key. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> So I've already browned two. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> I'm just going to finish with these last two. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Let the oil get them nice and brown around the outside <time_token_52> <time_token_52> just a couple of minutes on each side until they're nice and golden brown <time_token_52> <time_token_53> and then we want them to be at 165 degrees for a finished temperature. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> All right, so it's been a couple of minutes. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> I just want to go ahead and check them. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> Yeah, that's beautiful. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> Got that beautiful sort of paper bag brown that we're looking for. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> You can see the edges get a little crispier than the middle <time_token_56> <time_token_56> so you get that great textural difference. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Going to be another couple of minutes on this side <time_token_57> <time_token_57> and then we're going to build them, get them in the oven. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> All right, so it's been a couple of minutes on this side. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Before I remove them from the pan, I just want to get right into the thickest part. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> And again, remember, these are very evenly pounded <time_token_59> <time_token_60> so the thickest part could be any of it, but I still like to go in the middle <time_token_60> <time_token_60> just to make sure I'm getting an accurate temperature. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> You know, it's chicken so we're looking for 165 degrees. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> You know, another thing I like about, you know, chicken cutlets <time_token_62> <time_token_63> or breaded cutlets in general is because we're cooking them so quickly, <time_token_63> <time_token_64> they're going to still be nice and moist. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> So then I'm just going to remove these to paper towel <time_token_64> <time_token_65> just to drain a little bit of that excess oil off. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> All right, and now I've got a clean set of tongs, okay, <time_token_66> <time_token_66> because this chicken is already cooked. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> We've hit our temperature. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> And I'm going to move it over to my cookie sheet <time_token_67> <time_token_67> that I have lined with some parchment paper. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> I always think it's a great idea to line any tray that I'm using <time_token_68> <time_token_68> for baking with parchment paper. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> It really makes cleanup a lot easier, okay? <time_token_69> <time_token_70> And then just go ahead now that these have had a chance to drain. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> Again, same idea here. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> We didn't overcrowd the pan when we were browning them. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> I don't want to overcrowd the pan when I'm baking them as well. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> So I can just go ahead and get rid of that, okay? <time_token_72> <time_token_73> And now this is the fun part, and this is what everybody always likes <time_token_73> <time_token_73> about chicken parmesan. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> We've got some delicious seasoned tomato sauce here. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> And I'm just going to go ahead and parse out over these chicken breasts. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> And you want to be, again, I've talked about layering for this whole recipe. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> You don't want to have too much of anything. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> You want to have just enough so you get a little bite of sauce, <time_token_78> <time_token_79> crispy chicken, and cheese in every single bite. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> That's the idea. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> So I'll just spread that out, <time_token_79> <time_token_80> and then I'm just going to take the back of my spoon <time_token_80> <time_token_81> and sort of push it out almost to the edge. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> We've got that. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> I've got a little bit of whole milk mozzarella cheese. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Same idea as the sauce. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Now this cheese is going to melt, <time_token_83> <time_token_84> and it's going to spread out a little bit as it melts. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> So I try to keep it a little bit more towards the center <time_token_84> <time_token_85> just to accommodate for that. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> But the good news is when it melts off the side, <time_token_85> <time_token_86> you get those beautiful crispy brown bits of cheese that sort of stick to the pan. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> I always like to eat those. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> And again, chicken parmesan. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> I want to gild the lily just a little bit here. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> I've got a little more parmesan reggiano. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Remember, I put that in the seasoned breadcrumbs <time_token_89> <time_token_89> during the breading process, <time_token_89> <time_token_90> and I want to just take a little bit more, <time_token_90> <time_token_91> adds a nice sort of nutty and salty quality to the mozzarella, <time_token_91> <time_token_91> which is going to get all warm and soft and gooey. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> There you go. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> I'm going to put it in the oven for just a few minutes, <time_token_92> <time_token_93> get that cheese melted, get that sauce hot, <time_token_93> <time_token_93> and we're going to be ready to go. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> I've got eight minutes in the oven, <time_token_93> <time_token_94> and that's exactly what I'm looking for. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Cheese is all soft and gooey. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> Sauce is hot. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> Classically, I'll always serve this with just a nice simple pasta, <time_token_95> <time_token_96> simple tomato sauce. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> And this is perfect right there. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> Textbook, classic chicken parmesan. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> Everybody in your family is going to like it. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> It's a great meal, <time_token_98> <time_token_98> and the leftovers taste just as good the next day, too. <time_token_98> <time_token_98> Try it at home.

I'm Chef Tom. Today I'm going to show you how to make vegetarian wonton soup, and I have this food processor. <time_token_1> <time_token_3> I mix in with cabbage, shiitake mushroom, sari, broccoli, and green onion, and nara green. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> I blend it for maybe like 30 minutes. This is the texture that you want. I have a small KitchenAid. Perfect. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> So now what I'm going to do is, I have the vegetable already blended. I'm going to put it right here into my stainless steel bowl. <time_token_6> <time_token_8> And for some reason, when I blend this vegetable, there's not much juice. So this is good. But if you have a little bit, that's okay. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> But if you have a lot, then you want to squeeze out the juice. So this is good for me. I like it like this. <time_token_9> <time_token_12> And I have one firm tofu, and I just smash the tofu like this. Okay. Okay. That's good. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> And then, I'm going to sprinkle some salt. I'm going to season with the vegetarian, or the vegetable, black pepper. <time_token_14> <time_token_16> And I'm going to put a little bit of garlic and ginger. Okay. And then, a little bit of the sesame oil. <time_token_17> <time_token_18> Get them a nice flavor. I'm just going to mix it well like this. Mix it well. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> The vegetable I put in here, they don't have a lot of juice. If you use napa, and they're going to have a lot of juice of your bean sprout, then you need to squeeze out the juice. <time_token_20> <time_token_22> But I'm using dry mushroom, shiitake, and the raw green, and the cabbage. So it smells really good. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> The sesame oil gives them a really nice flavor. So there's no juice, plus I'm using the firm tofu. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> So now, this is a good filling for vegetarian. It's got a nice shiitake mushroom flavor for the wonton. <time_token_24> <time_token_26> It will give you a really nice flavor, combined with the crunchy cabbage. It gives you a great texture. It's ready to wrap. I'll show you how to do it. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> Okay. Now, I'm going to show you how to wrap the wonton. First, you will get this fresh wonton skin from the Asian market. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> Sometimes they come in frozen. In that case, you need to defrost it, and make sure they are nice and fluffy like this, separated. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> Each one is evenly like this. This is the filling I have. I have one egg here, and I'll show you how to wrap. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> So basically, you're just going to put some filling in the middle of the wonton, and you fold it in like half. Don't have to be perfect. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Tap some egg on this side, and then you just roll around like this. I'll show you a few more. <time_token_36> <time_token_40> This is how you do it, like this. In the meantime, I have a part of the stock boiling, and you can use chicken stock, or you can use vegetable stock, any way you like. <time_token_40> <time_token_42> This is how you do it. Put some egg right here. Go around. Let me show you closer so you can see it. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> Take one, and put some filling in. Don't have to be a lot. This wonton skin is Shanghai wonton skin. Very thin. <time_token_45> <time_token_48> You put a little bit here, and you have the firm tofu and all the vegetables. Use a food processor, and they have a really nice flavor like this. <time_token_48> <time_token_51> I'm going to show you the rest. I have a part of the water boiling, so I'm going to turn the heat down a little bit, because the wonton don't require this high heat. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> We don't want the wonton to break apart, so I'm going to turn it down to medium. <time_token_52> <time_token_55> I'm going to sprinkle some salt, and some pepper, and the soy sauce as you wish. Maybe just a little bit. Get a little flavor, like this, just a little bit. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> Then a little bit of the sesame oil. We're going to garnish with some green onion and roasted garlic. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Now, we just want the soup to have a little boiling, like this. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> We're ready to put our wonton in. All the wonton is beautiful. Sit right here, and you can just pick it up by your hand, like this. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> See? Isn't that beautiful? It's almost like a little boat. <time_token_62> <time_token_65> You can make this wonton ahead of time and put it in the refrigerator, and you can just cook as many as you wish. <time_token_65> <time_token_67> I think this is good enough. See? The water is turning down a little bit, so we're going to crank the heat a little bit. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> We just want to make sure we don't want too hot of the water to break the wonton. Just gently go like this. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> If you want to add pork, or chicken, or ground turkey, that's fine. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> I find out, I show you my processor. This is one of my small processors, right here, this one, KitchenAid, the small one. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> It's just perfect. You just use the chop for not even more than a minute, and the juice stays inside. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Here we go. You see how beautiful? This is going to take about 2-3 minutes because it's all vegetable. <time_token_76> <time_token_79> This Shanghai wonton skin is very thin. I like it. This is one of my favorites. It's very popular. <time_token_79> <time_token_82> It's a great way to have a snack, just something light. If you have spinach, cilantro, or anything you want to garnish later will be fine. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Once you can tell, the noodle is tender, soft. This is done because usually here we're just cooking the noodle. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> One time I know the filling is going to be yummy and tasty, so just like that. You really don't need to bring it to a boil. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> If you want, you can have a taste of your broth. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> Very good. Actually, the wonton is some part of the flour, the wonton gives the soup another kind of flavor. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> A little bit soft. See, this is the medium heat. The soup starts bringing up to the boil. It's done. It's beautiful. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> All the wonton look beautiful, swimming nice and good. Nothing broke. It's beautiful. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> Maybe just a little high heat like this. The soup is done. <time_token_94> <time_token_96> Vegetarian, healthy, yummy, wonton soup. I garnish with some green onion and the roasted garlic is the option. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> Look at that. How beautiful the wonton. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> Delicious. I'm Chef Tom.

making Samosas, Crispy Hot Samosas. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> The famous Mumbai roadside snacks, people have it as it is or usually it is served sandwich <time_token_4> <time_token_5> between Ladi Pals. <time_token_5> <time_token_7> For this recipe we need plain flour, salt, ghee, carom seeds, boiled potatoes, boiled <time_token_7> <time_token_9> green peas, whole coriander seeds, cumin seeds, asafoetida, garam masala, dry mango powder, <time_token_9> <time_token_10> ginger green chilli paste, coriander and oil. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> So now we begin making the recipe. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> This recipe is divided into two parts, the dough and the stuffing. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> So first we will make the dough. <time_token_11> <time_token_14> For this we need plain flour, a little melted ghee, carom seeds and of course salt. <time_token_14> <time_token_16> Mix this well and we will knead into a stiff dough, remember this it has to be a very stiff <time_token_16> <time_token_17> dough using a little water. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> Samosas are usually enjoyed hot and crispy. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> Now if you really want very crispy samosas, you can add a teaspoon of corn flour to the <time_token_20> <time_token_21> This will really make the outer covering crisp. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> So our dough is ready and as you all know all the doughs require a little resting period. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> We are going to cover it and keep aside for 15 minutes at least until then we will make <time_token_25> <time_token_27> So for the stuffing we need oil, let it heat a bit, then we will start tempering a little <time_token_27> <time_token_28> cumin seeds and as they crackle a little asafoetida. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> And then the spice, ginger green chilli paste, saute it for a while and then add the potato, <time_token_32> <time_token_35> boiled green peas, mix it well, mash them a little lightly using your spoon and allow <time_token_35> <time_token_36> them to cook for 2-3 minutes. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> Ensure that when you boil and chop the potatoes they are not cut into very big cubes. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> And when you mash them like this while cooking they get uniformly mixed. <time_token_40> <time_token_43> So now we will add the masalas, garam masala, dry mango powder, a little whole coriander <time_token_43> <time_token_44> seeds, you can crush them as well and of course salt. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Let the masalas also cook for 2 minutes and then we will add the common Indian herb, coriander. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Mix this again, so here's our stuffing ready. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> A little variation to this made in some households is also using mint paste. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> What you can do is get a little mint leaves and combine them with green chillies, a little <time_token_52> <time_token_53> lemon juice, a little salt and blend it in a mixer and add that paste to this stuffing <time_token_53> <time_token_54> and here I have used garam masala. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> In that you can replace garam masala with pao bhaji masala. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> This is just a variation, if you wish you can also make the stuffing using mint paste. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> So our stuffing is ready, our dough has been rested well, now we will make the samosas. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> And before you begin rolling ensure that you keep the oil for deep frying to heat and then <time_token_58> <time_token_60> take the dough and knead it once, divide this into 2 equal portions and we will roll <time_token_60> <time_token_60> out one portion into an oval shape. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> Now I am going to roll it into an oval shape but if you are not comfortable you can also <time_token_61> <time_token_61> roll it into a round. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> Also remember one more thing, when making this outer covering for the samosas a common <time_token_65> <time_token_66> mistake most people make is they roll this very thinly. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Now this will break when you deep fry them. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> So please ensure that you do not roll it very thinly. <time_token_67> <time_token_70> Now we will cut it into two, pick one portion, hold it like this on your palm and now we <time_token_70> <time_token_71> start rolling it from one end to the other end to form a cone. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> This is how we form a cone. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> Press the edge a bit so that the stuffing is well sealed inside. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Now here's your cone ready. <time_token_74> <time_token_75> Take a little stuffing and stuff it well. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Press it a bit and using a little water seal these edges. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Press a little from this edge as well and here's our samosa ready. <time_token_79> <time_token_82> Let's do one more, first we make it into a cone, take the stuffing, press it a bit and <time_token_82> <time_token_84> Here our samosas are ready to be deep fried and our oil is also ready for deep fry. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> So let's deep fry them. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> Ensure you cook them on a very medium flame or else the covering from outside will brown <time_token_87> <time_token_87> but from inside it will yet be uncooked. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Also remember to use enough oil for deep frying. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Cook them till they are golden brown from both the sides and if you have a party at home <time_token_89> <time_token_90> you can keep these samosas half cooked and then deep fry when your guests come rather <time_token_90> <time_token_91> than keeping them just uncooked. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> So our samosas are getting ready now, crispy hot samosas are ready. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Drain them on a tissue paper and now they are ready to be served. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Try them and let us know about this recipe.

Here are the ingredients, let's take a look. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> I have about 250 grams of minced meat. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> Spaghetti that's been cooked. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> Tomato puree, 3 fourth cup, bread crumbs. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> 3 large tomatoes has been blanched and chopped. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> Basil leaves, dried oregano. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> Pepper, 1 onion finely chopped. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> Mixed herbs, whatchaya sauce, paprika powder, <time_token_12> <time_token_13> 1 egg, few cloves of garlic that's been chopped. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Sugar, salt and some olive oil. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> First we are going to make the meatballs. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> For that you need about 250 grams of minced meat. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> To this I am going to add a few cloves of chopped garlic. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> Some salt, some pepper, whatchaya sauce. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> You will get this in any speciality store. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> 1 egg, slightly whisk it. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> Pour the egg into the meat. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> And gently mix everything together. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> Once you have done that, add the bread crumbs finely. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> The meat is ready, so now you keep it for about 5 to 10 minutes. <time_token_29> <time_token_30> And then make small balls and fry it. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> I am just going to toss the cooked spaghetti with a little herbs and oil. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> For that take about 1 to 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a pan. <time_token_34> <time_token_34> Just add about a quarter teaspoon of mixed herbs. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Instant, I am getting a lovely instant aroma of the dried mixed herbs. <time_token_37> <time_token_37> To this just add the cooked spaghetti. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> So you can see that what oil has done is just helped to loosen the spaghetti a bit. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> It is nice and smooth now. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> So this is done. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> I am going to just transfer it into a bowl. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Next I am going to make the sauce. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> For that take about 2 to 3 teaspoons of olive oil. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Drop in the onions, chopped onions. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Saute the onions and garlic for about few minutes. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Say till they are about golden brown. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> Add the blanched and chopped tomatoes. <time_token_51> <time_token_53> Make sure you get lovely red, ripe tomatoes when you make the tomato sauce. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> To this I am going to add the dried oregano. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> I am adding a little paprika. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> This is optional. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Just add it to get a lovely flavor. <time_token_61> <time_token_61> Pour in the tomato puree. <time_token_62> <time_token_64> Just pour a half cup of water to get the sauce simmering. <time_token_64> <time_token_66> I am just going to add a small teaspoon of sugar just to balance the flavors. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Together I have a lovely sweetness and tanginess to this. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Now let the sauce start simmering. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> Now I am going to make the meatballs. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> A bit of oil to this pan. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> We are just going to shallow fry. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Now I am going to make the meatballs. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Let's take a little. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Don't take too much. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> You don't want the meatballs to be too big. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> This size will be fine. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Once the pink color is gone and you have nice light brown color. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> You can remove the meatballs and put it in the sauce. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> As the sauce is simmering along with the meatballs just add a few leaves of basil. <time_token_80> <time_token_82> This gives a wonderful flavor to any Italian dish that you prepare. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> Gently mix it in. <time_token_83> <time_token_83> Now I am going to plate the spaghetti with the meatballs. <time_token_83> <time_token_85> Take a little roll it up and place it in a lovely small bowl. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> And place the meatballs sauce on top. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> Don't mix the spaghetti with the sauce. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> The person eating it will actually do it for themselves. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Garnish it with some grated Parmesan.

It's just slice the celery <time_token_8> <time_token_9> Then slice your carrot and leave the skin on there's a lot of flavor in that skin. Slice your mushrooms <time_token_9> <time_token_11> And when you're slicing tuck your two fingers back there and put your middle finger forward <time_token_11> <time_token_12> Tuck your nails in and use this part as a guide. So when you slice you can't chop your fingers off <time_token_12> <time_token_14> And it's safe. Or if you feel uncomfortable chopping or slicing anything like that just cut it in half <time_token_14> <time_token_14> So it's all flat <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Again, take your two fingers back middle finger up tucked in <time_token_16> <time_token_17> Like that because when you've got your fingers like that and your nails tucked in and use that as a guide <time_token_17> <time_token_17> So when you're chopping fast or slow <time_token_17> <time_token_18> There's no way you're gonna chop your fingers off <time_token_18> <time_token_18> So I do this <time_token_19> <time_token_20> It's all safe and if you're cutting anything long like a carrot or a celery get I mean sometimes <time_token_20> <time_token_21> I don't do it, but you get your thumb like that to hold it <time_token_21> <time_token_22> Get your fingers again tucked back and your middle finger in front and then just chop <time_token_23> <time_token_23> Just like that like a guide <time_token_24> <time_token_25> Next I'm going to be using one potato very traditionally minestrone soup. I'm just going to dice it <time_token_26> <time_token_27> I'm going to be using some beautiful sun-dried tomatoes. So just roughly chop them <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Next just shred some cabbage <time_token_28> <time_token_29> Also, I'm going to be using some beautiful nice cauliflower florets <time_token_29> <time_token_30> I'm going to be using some beautiful good quality smoky ham. You can use pancetta, but this is really good quality <time_token_31> <time_token_31> Just gives it a nice <time_token_31> <time_token_31> Smoky taste because it's smoky ham <time_token_32> <time_token_32> Just wipe your garlic <time_token_32> <time_token_32> And just leave that whole <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Okay, I've got a heavy base pan really heavy <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Really good for making soup like this on a medium heat. We're gonna add some olive oil and plenty of that in <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Okay, so what we're going to add is the onion <time_token_37> <time_token_38> Carrots mushrooms celery <time_token_39> <time_token_39> Next add the ham and <time_token_39> <time_token_40> Next add the potatoes and cauliflower in <time_token_41> <time_token_41> Some dry tomatoes in and the cabbage <time_token_42> <time_token_43> And also it's very important that this soup is seasoned as you go. So I had a good generous pinch of salt <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Also some pepper <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Give everything a good stir and you really want to cook all this out <time_token_45> <time_token_46> For about 15 minutes to get some really good color on there caramelize it like a little bit <time_token_46> <time_token_47> Because this is the heart and soul of the soup. So really really <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Stir it cook it out and add your liquid <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Okay, this has been cooking for like five minutes and it smells actually fantastic <time_token_50> <time_token_51> So put some dried herbs in there when you put some oregano in there <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Some basil dried basil <time_token_52> <time_token_52> Give it a stir <time_token_53> <time_token_55> Okay, that's been cooking 10 minutes and like I said, it's very important to get all these sweated out get all the flavors out <time_token_55> <time_token_56> And then next what I'm going to do add some really good quality tomatoes <time_token_56> <time_token_57> And give that a stir <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Also add some peas some sweet peas this just gives it a really beautiful sweetness <time_token_58> <time_token_60> Next add a good quality chicken stock either homemade or from the store also adding some water <time_token_60> <time_token_61> And one of the secrets to this dish <time_token_61> <time_token_62> I'm gonna use some parmesan rind and that just lifts the dish that just makes it extra extra special. So just pop that in and <time_token_62> <time_token_63> The secret to this dish is we're going to put it in the oven <time_token_63> <time_token_65> We're gonna cook it for two hours and what that will do that will intensify all the flavors and it's gonna be fantastic <time_token_65> <time_token_65> So put a lid on <time_token_66> <time_token_66> I'm gonna put it in the oven <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Okay, this has been cooking for one hour <time_token_68> <time_token_69> So remove the lid and that it's most absolutely beautiful. It's really well worth it and <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Whoa, man, some flavors in there. Okay. So next just add one cup of water <time_token_71> <time_token_72> And then put it back in the oven let's have a look at this <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Look at that guys <time_token_73> <time_token_74> You know, it's well worth it, you know to cook it for a long long time and the maximum flavor <time_token_74> <time_token_75> I've got those vegetables the broth everything is <time_token_75> <time_token_75> Beautiful. Let's have a taste <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Wow that parmesan rind you can really taste it I've taken it out. So now what we're gonna do <time_token_78> <time_token_78> We're gonna add some parsley <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I'm gonna add some peas to that some salt. I know it needs salt <time_token_79> <time_token_80> Some ground white pepper <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Also, add the parkour rigatoni and that'll continue cooking in the soup. So give everything a good stir <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Parsley on there <time_token_88> <time_token_90> Some fresh garlic just on top and definitely some beautiful grated parmesan cheese just on top <time_token_90> <time_token_90> Some ground black pepper <time_token_91> <time_token_91> And just a drizzle of olive oil <time_token_92> <time_token_93> And also what's really good with minestrone is some beautiful white fish serves on top there <time_token_94> <time_token_95> So there you go guys, hope you enjoyed it <time_token_95> <time_token_95> Absolutely one of my favorite soups of all time <time_token_95> <time_token_97> Easy to do you can add anything you want in there, but the secret is is just to cook it for a long long time ", "duration": 443.67, "segments": [[34, 107], [110, 115], [118, 123], [126, 130], [136, 144], [145, 149], [156, 160], [164, 192], [197, 220], [228, 241], [249, 286], [291, 309], [347, 365]], "seg_text": "<time_token_7> <time_token_23> <time_token_24> <time_token_25> <time_token_26> <time_token_27> <time_token_28> <time_token_29> <time_token_30> <time_token_32> <time_token_32> <time_token_33> <time_token_34> <time_token_35> <time_token_36> <time_token_42> <time_token_43> <time_token_49> <time_token_50> <time_token_53> <time_token_55> <time_token_63> <time_token_64> <time_token_68> <time_token_77> <time_token_81>", "pure_cap": "slice celery carrot and mushroom into small pieces. chop peeled potatoes to dices. cut some tomatoes into puree. shred some cabbage and prepare some cauliflowers. slice some smoke ham to strips. crush some garlic. heat some olive oil in a pan. add chopped vegetables and the ham. add a little bit black pepper and stir. add some oregano and basil and stir. add tomato puree sweet peas chicken stock water and parmesan cheese to the pot. cover the pan and cook in an oven. add parsley peas salt pepper and pasta"}, {"image_id": "TMpt-41UTOk.mp4", "caption": "<time_token_11> <time_token_15> combine the meat with half of the onion salt bay leaf dried mushrooms peppercorns and water <time_token_15> <time_token_17> cook for around an hour and let it cool <time_token_24> <time_token_28> grind the cooked meat mixture in a food processor <time_token_29> <time_token_32> chop the other half of the onion and cook it with a little bit of oil <time_token_32> <time_token_33> transfer the meat in to a bowl and add the onion <time_token_34> <time_token_37> season with salt and pepper and mix very well <time_token_45> <time_token_47> in the food processor add flour and salt <time_token_47> <time_token_51> pulse few times and then add the water <time_token_52> <time_token_53> let the food processor process the dough for another minute <time_token_56> <time_token_57> divide the dough in 2 portions <time_token_58> <time_token_61> keep rolling until you get 1 to 2 mm thick dough <time_token_62> <time_token_62> with a glass or large cookie cutter cut circles and take the remaining dough <time_token_70> <time_token_77> wrap the meat mixture in the small dough portions <time_token_78> <time_token_80> boil the wrapped pierogies in boiling salted water <time_token_86> <time_token_91> fry the boiled pierogies with a little oil in a pan and then serve", "id": 382, "seg_prompt": "563 ; 66, 89 ; 90, 101 ; 138, 162 ; 168, 182 ; 185, 188 ; 194, 214 ; 257, 270 ; 272, 292 ; 298, 302 ; 321, 327 ; 330, 352 ; 354, 358 ; 400, 439 ; 446, 460 ; 493, 523................", "asr_text": "<time_token_1> <time_token_2> Hi, I'm Ania. Welcome to my kitchen. Today, I'm going to show you how to prepare pierogi. <time_token_2> <time_token_3> This is a recipe I got from my mom and we're going to be preparing today pierogi zmiesem, <time_token_3> <time_token_5> which is pierogi with meat and those are favorite of Sebastian's. And there are so many different <time_token_5> <time_token_6> types of pierogi. They can be done with meat, with cabbage, with fruits, sweet, sour, spicy, <time_token_6> <time_token_7> whichever way you want to go, you can go with pierogi. But today, let's make Sebastian happy. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> Let's have a look at the ingredients so you know what you need. <time_token_10> <time_token_12> I am starting with my meat. I'm putting it into the large pot together with half of the onion, <time_token_12> <time_token_14> my dried mushrooms, bay leaf, few peppercorns and a teaspoon of salt. And then I'm going to <time_token_14> <time_token_16> add enough water just to cover the meat. Here we go. Okay, and then on a medium-medium high heat, <time_token_16> <time_token_18> I'm going to be cooking it for an hour. Right, and this is ready. Now it's time to fish it out. So we <time_token_18> <time_token_19> take our onion, the dried mushrooms and the meat out and then we let it cool it a little bit so <time_token_19> <time_token_20> it doesn't burn our fingers. But the stock you want to keep because you might need it later. It's <time_token_20> <time_token_22> pretty hot, so I wouldn't use it for anything else. But we might need a few tablespoons or <time_token_22> <time_token_23> half a cup for the stuffing later on. Okay, our meat cooled down a little bit and I'm going to cut <time_token_23> <time_token_24> that into smaller pieces just so it's easier to use the grinder later. Here we go. And through <time_token_24> <time_token_26> the grinder goes the meat, the onion and the dried mushrooms. Now if you do not have a grinder, <time_token_26> <time_token_27> you can use the food processor for that as well. You just need to make sure that the meat is very <time_token_27> <time_token_29> well processed. Here we go. In goes the onion and the mushrooms. And then on my frying pan, <time_token_29> <time_token_30> I have around a tablespoon of oil. I'm adding my onion. That's the other half of the onion which <time_token_30> <time_token_31> I chopped finely. And I'm going to be cooking it for three, four minutes until it's nice, <time_token_31> <time_token_33> soft and glossy. Just like that. And now we're adding our onion to the meat. <time_token_34> <time_token_36> And then adding some salt and pepper. Okay, and now we start mixing it. So first I'm working with <time_token_36> <time_token_38> my spoon and then I'm switching to my hand. I'm going to be working on my meat for around five, <time_token_38> <time_token_39> seven minutes. It just needs to get elastic and in my case it was a little bit dry. So I added <time_token_39> <time_token_40> half a cup of the juice again. Of the stock, sorry. And then we work it some more. And now <time_token_40> <time_token_41> the best thing is to do the stuffing one day and then the pierogi the other day. <time_token_41> <time_token_42> But you could do it right now. But for me that was evening and I just packed it nicely with the <time_token_43> <time_token_43> aluminum foil and I put it in the fridge. Now the next day I started with putting <time_token_44> <time_token_45> water into my largest pot, added a teaspoon of salt and let it bring to a boil. And in the meantime, <time_token_45> <time_token_46> into my food processor, I'm adding the flour. <time_token_46> <time_token_47> And then a teaspoon of salt. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> And then I'm going to process it just a little bit so the salt mixes with the flour. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Here we go. We pulse it through time. Yes, here we go. That's done. And then slowly here in the cup <time_token_50> <time_token_51> I have water, which was just boiling. It's not boiling hot, but it's still very, very warm and <time_token_51> <time_token_52> very slowly I'm adding it into my food processor. And as you can see, when it starts forming a bowl <time_token_52> <time_token_53> like this, I'm checking if it's soft and then you should run it for another minute or so. And then <time_token_53> <time_token_55> it's ready. Here we go. We lightly flour the surface, transfer our dough on it. And now I'm <time_token_55> <time_token_57> going to knead it a few times, but it gets elastic and not sticky very quickly. Okay, so now I'm <time_token_57> <time_token_58> cutting it in half. One half I'm putting for later on into a Ziploc bag. And the other half we're <time_token_58> <time_token_59> going to be rolling and it's a lot of rolling and flipping that also it doesn't stick to the table. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> Here we go. We want to roll it pretty thin between one and two millimeters. It also depends how you <time_token_61> <time_token_62> like it. You might want it a little bit thicker or a little bit thinner. For me, I like it around <time_token_62> <time_token_63> two millimeters. I don't like it too thin. Here we go. And then with my glass, I'm cutting circles <time_token_63> <time_token_64> and then I'm taking the remaining dough and I'm going to put it, add it to the rest of the, <time_token_65> <time_token_66> here we go, dough into my Ziploc bag just so it doesn't dry out and we can still use it. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Now my plate, I'm sprinkling with the flour because I don't want my pierogi to stick. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> And then I'm putting water on the side. Just my mom told me that in case my pierogi are getting <time_token_68> <time_token_69> too dry and they don't want to close, I want to put a little bit of water on the edges. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> I did not have that problem. Okay, so I'm picking up my dough. Very important, the circles you want <time_token_70> <time_token_71> to flip it over so you're closing it with the size which was laying on the table. You put one <time_token_71> <time_token_72> tablespoon of the stuffing and then you nicely close it and then at the end I added a little <time_token_72> <time_token_74> bit of a decoration there. Here we go. So you stretch it out. Yep, then you flip it and then <time_token_74> <time_token_75> a tablespoon of stuffing. We squeeze it in. Kind of we stretch the dough around. Here we go, <time_token_75> <time_token_77> close it and make a little decoration. Here we go. Okay, so when we're done with all the circles <time_token_77> <time_token_79> our water is boiling now. So gently and carefully, so you don't get burned, you put all your pierogi <time_token_79> <time_token_80> inside. Now do not overcrowd. If you don't have the big pot like this just make it in in portions. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> Okay, with the wooden spoon I'm going to stir it a little bit so they don't stuck to the bottom <time_token_81> <time_token_82> and then when they float up it means that another minute and they are ready. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> So I sprayed my serving plate with a non-stick spray and it's time to fish out our pierogi. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Here we go. <time_token_85> <time_token_85> And off we go. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> Okay and now we want to spray them on top as well with a little bit of a non-stick spray <time_token_88> <time_token_89> and then there are many ways of serving pierogi but one of them is just to fry them <time_token_89> <time_token_89> on a little bit of oil that's favorite of Sebastian so that's what I'm doing here. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> But you could just serve them from water with some sour cream. You could serve them <time_token_90> <time_token_91> with some fried onion or with some fried bacon and onion. Different ways but today we're going <time_token_91> <time_token_92> to serve them fried. That's how it looks like. I hope guys you enjoyed the recipe. Please let <time_token_92> <time_token_93> me know what you think and I will see you next time. Bye!

My name is Keisha. I blog every <time_token_0> <time_token_1> day at kjaggers.com. The link to my blog is below. So today I am back sharing a <time_token_1> <time_token_3> recipe, a crock-pot recipe that is for a delicious soft taco stack that you can <time_token_3> <time_token_3> either help along on the stove and take minimal time in the crock-pot or you can <time_token_3> <time_token_4> do it all in the crock-pot. I'm going to explain the process all the way through <time_token_4> <time_token_5> and this is a little bit unconventional in the in the sense of how I'm sharing <time_token_5> <time_token_6> it. I'm not going to go through all of the different ingredients up front. I'm <time_token_6> <time_token_7> going to share them as we as we need them throughout the video and I will <time_token_7> <time_token_7> have everything written out in a corresponding blog post that you will be <time_token_7> <time_token_8> able to get to by clicking the link below in the down bar and you'll be able <time_token_8> <time_token_9> to have the recipe in full that is printable for your family to enjoy. So <time_token_9> <time_token_10> let's get started. I'm going to show you how to make this delicious taco stack. <time_token_10> <time_token_11> So even though this is a crock-pot meal, one of the nice things about this <time_token_11> <time_token_11> particular dinner is you don't have to get it in the crock-pot super early if <time_token_11> <time_token_13> you don't want to. So what I like to do for this recipe is go ahead and get the <time_token_13> <time_token_13> beef cooked up with the onions. That way it doesn't have to be in the crock-pot <time_token_13> <time_token_14> all day. You don't have to transfer and then layer the taco stack up. You can <time_token_14> <time_token_15> layer it simply out of this pot. So all I have in here is about two pounds of <time_token_15> <time_token_16> cube steak and if you did want to make it you know in the crock-pot all the way <time_token_16> <time_token_17> you would cut your cube steak up and put it in your crock-pot with one onion and <time_token_17> <time_token_18> then you would add some sauce and I will explain that in a minute. The <time_token_18> <time_token_18> enchilada sauce turn that on and let it cook for about five hours until your <time_token_18> <time_token_19> meat is nice and tender. So you can do that. You will have to take it out <time_token_19> <time_token_21> transfer it and make sure that you know you have another container ready so you <time_token_21> <time_token_22> can layer it up. But this only takes a couple minutes. You can go ahead and cook <time_token_22> <time_token_22> it on the stove just the meat while you get everything else ready and it makes <time_token_22> <time_token_23> it a little bit faster and a little bit easier but still if you have a game <time_token_23> <time_token_24> night or something going on you can prepare this a few minutes ahead of time <time_token_24> <time_token_25> get it in the crock-pot come back a couple hours later or maybe even just one <time_token_25> <time_token_26> hour later and dinner is completely ready. So very very easy to do. I'm gonna <time_token_26> <time_token_26> finish cooking up this meat and I'll show you how I assemble it in the crock-pot. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> You could use hamburger by the way sorry about all the the steam. You could <time_token_28> <time_token_29> use hamburger by the way and that is a cheaper alternative but I found this <time_token_29> <time_token_30> chopstick on sale and I use this in the husband approved steak sandwiches and I <time_token_30> <time_token_30> love it and I find it just a little bit better but you could definitely use just <time_token_30> <time_token_32> a ground round if you wish. Be sure to drain it though. So rather you're <time_token_32> <time_token_33> cooking your meat on the stove or in the crock-pot when it is done you will need <time_token_33> <time_token_34> to add one half can just a half a can of the enchilada sauce. I'm using mild and <time_token_34> <time_token_35> then I added one can of the traditional reef fried beans. Mix that up you can do <time_token_35> <time_token_36> this totally in the crock-pot and then transfer it to a bowl if you wanted you <time_token_36> <time_token_37> know not to have to cook the meat on the stove but you're still gonna have to mix <time_token_37> <time_token_38> in that half a can of enchilada sauce and the reef fried beans and that is <time_token_38> <time_token_39> what you got. So now let's get to making our taco stack. So in my crock-pot I have <time_token_39> <time_token_40> the other half of the mild enchilada sauce and you just put it on bottom and <time_token_40> <time_token_41> I'm gonna put one soft tortilla down. I'm just gonna kind of spread it around make <time_token_41> <time_token_42> sure it's got enchilada sauce under it and then we are gonna start building our <time_token_42> <time_token_43> taco stack. You're gonna spread some of that meat mixture on that first taco <time_token_43> <time_token_44> stack try to get it as even as you can and you're gonna have to you know work <time_token_44> <time_token_45> out of your bowl or skillet whichever you're using and then you're gonna add <time_token_45> <time_token_46> some cheese just like that and another tortilla and you're gonna keep doing <time_token_46> <time_token_47> that until you've used up all your meat and I usually like to try to at least <time_token_47> <time_token_48> get six of the tortillas in sometimes more so I'm gonna continue building this <time_token_48> <time_token_49> up and I'll show you how I finish it. <time_token_55> <time_token_58> Okay so I believe I have seven tortillas you can see they're all stacked up so <time_token_58> <time_token_59> let's recap for a second. We have half a can of the mild enchilada sauce at the <time_token_59> <time_token_60> bottom of the crock pot. We started out stacking soft tortilla on top of that <time_token_60> <time_token_62> enchilada sauce. We layered in our beef and onion mixture which for me is beef <time_token_62> <time_token_63> cube steak with an onion. We've added the other half can of the mild enchilada <time_token_63> <time_token_64> sauce, our refried beans. We stacked it up on soft tortillas within the crock pot <time_token_64> <time_token_65> added cheese in between each layer and now I'm at the top. So how I like to top <time_token_65> <time_token_66> this is with the Velveeta cheese sauce. This is the queso. It comes in these <time_token_66> <time_token_67> little packets like so and you're just going to pour one or two over the top. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Usually I put two. My husband loves this meal. This is one of his favorite meals <time_token_68> <time_token_69> of all time and I just squeeze this out. It's kind of hard to do while I'm on <time_token_69> <time_token_70> camera with one hand but I just like to squeeze this out and over the top and <time_token_70> <time_token_71> cover the entire top of the of the soft taco. So you can see that it's covered in <time_token_71> <time_token_72> the ooey gooey delicious Velveeta queso cheese. You can certainly make your own <time_token_72> <time_token_73> queso. You can make your own refried beans. Do what you wish. You can shred <time_token_73> <time_token_74> your own cheese. I'm showing you a quick way to do this but you could certainly <time_token_74> <time_token_75> you know add your own special touches. So here it is. I have the Velveeta cheese <time_token_75> <time_token_76> on top. I'm going to put my lid on and from this point dinner is done in basically <time_token_76> <time_token_77> either one hour on high or even one hour on low. Either which way it's just going <time_token_77> <time_token_78> to melt those cheeses. Warm everything up but you could keep it on low and your <time_token_78> <time_token_79> family you know could enjoy it whenever you were back from a game or back from <time_token_79> <time_token_80> church or whatever on any kind of night. It will be basically done in one hour <time_token_80> <time_token_81> but you can keep it on warm as long as you need to and even on low it will <time_token_81> <time_token_82> probably be done in close to one hour. Maybe one and a half hours to two hours <time_token_82> <time_token_83> but I like to put it on high when I'm home and get all those flavors mixed <time_token_83> <time_token_83> together and warmed up together and after about one hour you could certainly <time_token_83> <time_token_85> serve this up and I will show you how I do that next. So I just took my knife cut <time_token_85> <time_token_86> into it got a piece out and it is such a simple delicious meal. It can stay on low <time_token_86> <time_token_87> in the crock pot for a while and it will stay warm for your family especially <time_token_87> <time_token_88> if you know you have people running in and out. This is such a delicious easy <time_token_88> <time_token_89> meal to make. I'm going to show you how I plate it up next. So this is how we <time_token_89> <time_token_89> serve it up. You can see the different layers. I have a big dollop of whipped <time_token_89> <time_token_91> cream on top some salsa and also a couple scoops. I just used my melon <time_token_91> <time_token_92> baller inside of a avocado and that is our dinner and I hope you guys enjoyed <time_token_92> <time_token_93> this recipe. I promise if you make it for your family they will love it as much as <time_token_93> <time_token_93> my family does. You can use ground beef, you can use chicken, you can use cube <time_token_93> <time_token_94> steak, whatever makes you happy you could certainly do and again you can start <time_token_94> <time_token_95> this off on the stove or you can start it off in the crock pot whichever works <time_token_95> <time_token_95> for you.

today I'm going to attempt to make a goulash recipe, and usually these recipes <time_token_1> <time_token_3> calls for about three pounds of meat, and I'm trying to make it so I could have a smaller <time_token_3> <time_token_4> portion and I went with one pound of meat right here. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> So first let's start by cutting this meat to cubes, and we'll pat them dry, and we'll <time_token_6> <time_token_6> put some paprika on it, and we'll go from there. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> Okay, nice piece. <time_token_8> <time_token_10> A little on the thick side, but okay, so that's a good one. <time_token_13> <time_token_15> So next up, we'll just pat them dry, because we're going to brown them, and we want them <time_token_15> <time_token_15> to brown nicely, we don't want them to steam down. <time_token_16> <time_token_18> Grab some paprika, about a tablespoon of paprika. <time_token_19> <time_token_22> And we'll just also add some fresh brown pepper, and mix it on. <time_token_22> <time_token_24> Now let's set this aside, we're going to add leftovers, so we need one medium onion, <time_token_24> <time_token_25> just sliced, like that, and we'll break it up. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> Alright, so for this we're going to use a little bit of olive oil to saute the onions, <time_token_28> <time_token_31> put this on a medium-high to start, and just, you know, just break the pizza so they're <time_token_31> <time_token_32> not clumped together. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> Now that they're semi-translucent, we're going to just move them to a separate plate. <time_token_37> <time_token_39> And by the way, for this I'm using the Cuisinart 6-port 3-ply, and really good pot in there. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> The next step is to sear the meat, so for that we're going to put the heat on high, <time_token_41> <time_token_42> and this thing is starting to smell better and want to kind of dip. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> So I'm just going to transfer the meat here. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> All four sides of the meat, all sides of the meat sear. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> It's going to take us about five minutes or so. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> So we've got nice searing here, and at this point I'm going to add water. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> And we're going to add about one-third of a can of 6-ounce tomato paste. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> I'm going to lower the temperature a little. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> We're going to add the onions. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> We're going to add about a teaspoon of cumin, something like this, a quarter of a teaspoon <time_token_61> <time_token_61> of sesame or vegetable, but I'm adding vegetable. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> And I like to use this brand. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> It's the balsam soup and seasoning mix, and it's really great. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> It has a lot of flavor. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> About two tablespoons. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> Go ahead and stir this thing up and make sure you pick up the bits and pieces from the bottom of the pan. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> And we're going to bring it down to a simmer and go ahead and cover the pan. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> And this can go like that for about an hour and a half, so I'm going to set the timer for an hour and a half. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Maybe an hour and ten. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> I would come back after an hour and check the tenderness of the meat. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> And if it needs a little more cooking, then just continue to cook it. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> All right, so it's been about 30 minutes, and I'm going to give it a good stir here. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> It smells great. <time_token_78> <time_token_80> All right, so the one hour and ten minutes or so has passed, and I steer the pot from every 30 minutes or so. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> And I don't think it's ready. <time_token_81> <time_token_83> I think it does need another half hour, but I'm just going to grab one and I'm going to cut into it and taste it and see how it looks. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> Let's see if I like it. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> And by the way, this is the texture. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> This is good. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> It's actually, I think it's actually ready. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> It's nice, isn't it? <time_token_91> <time_token_92> So yeah, this is ready. <time_token_92> <time_token_95> And this was my recipe for the Hungarian goulash using the Cuisinart six quart three-ply pot. <time_token_95> <time_token_97> So if you enjoyed this video, please thumb

35, 65 ; 66, 76 ; 79, 92 ; 107, 117..................................................................", "asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_4> G'day everyone and welcome. Today I'm making one of my all time favourites and it is so <time_token_4> <time_token_7> delicious and so easy to make at home. So for starters you'll of course need some chicken. <time_token_7> <time_token_9> Now I've cut up a whole chicken here into pieces. You can of course buy your chicken <time_token_9> <time_token_15> pieces pre-cut. I've got a couple of drumsticks. The thighs. The wings with half of the breasts <time_token_15> <time_token_19> attached and the other half of the breasts. I'm using a 1 kilo chicken for this. I find <time_token_19> <time_token_21> that larger chickens take too long to cook and the outer coating becomes over cooked <time_token_21> <time_token_24> so stick around the 1 kilo mark. Now for the seasoning. I've got 1 cup of plain flour, <time_token_25> <time_token_31> 1 tablespoon of salt, a teaspoon of ground black pepper, about a quarter teaspoon of <time_token_31> <time_token_34> cayenne pepper. Now this doesn't make it hot, it just gives it a bit of a kick. Half <time_token_34> <time_token_38> a tablespoon of garlic powder, a tablespoon of onion powder, a teaspoon of dried mixed <time_token_38> <time_token_41> herbs and now for the secret ingredient that will make it super crunchy. I've got some <time_token_41> <time_token_44> instant potato mash powder and I'm going to add in half a cup of this. Give this a good <time_token_44> <time_token_47> mix together and it's time to prepare the chicken. So here I'm just taking a piece of <time_token_47> <time_token_49> chicken and I'm just going to dip it in some egg wash which is just a couple of beaten <time_token_49> <time_token_52> eggs mixed with a little bit of water and then into the flour mix and onto a plate and <time_token_52> <time_token_55> I'm going to repeat this for all of the chicken pieces and set it to one side for 20 minutes <time_token_55> <time_token_58> and then it's time to do it again. So into the egg wash, back into the flour and what <time_token_58> <time_token_61> this does is it gives it a lovely thick coating and this will help make that chicken super <time_token_61> <time_token_64> crunchy. So again just repeat this for all of the chicken, leave it to one side for 20 <time_token_64> <time_token_66> minutes before cooking and it's time to fry it. So here I've got some canola oil preheated <time_token_66> <time_token_69> to 180 celsius or 350 fahrenheit and I'm just going to gently place in half of those chicken <time_token_69> <time_token_73> pieces. You don't want to overcrowd your oil here and I'm going to cook this for 15 minutes <time_token_73> <time_token_75> turning it every 3-4 minutes and this will ensure the chicken is cooked nice and evenly <time_token_76> <time_token_78> and once it's done I'm going to remove it from the fryer and place it onto a rack to <time_token_78> <time_token_81> remove any excess oil and just repeat this step for the rest of your chicken. And this <time_token_81> <time_token_83> is what you get guys. Be sure to leave it for about 10 minutes or so before digging <time_token_83> <time_token_88> in so you don't burn your mouth and enjoy. Now this recipe is so delicious that extra <time_token_88> <time_token_90> crunch really tops off your standard fried chicken so give it a go. If you want some <time_token_90> <time_token_93> more recipes check out my BBQ Cooking Channel, my Google Plus and my Facebook pages.

Welcome to Betty's kitchen. Today we're making mini corn dogs and <time_token_2> <time_token_3> this is another one of our Super Bowl snacks or it can be a snack for any <time_token_3> <time_token_4> occasion. I've made corn dogs already. If you want to look those up in Betty's <time_token_4> <time_token_5> kitchen, those are the full-size hot dog. So it's just about that long and it's <time_token_5> <time_token_6> dipped in cornmeal mixture and it's deep-fried. So if you like the full-size <time_token_6> <time_token_7> corn dog, use that recipe. But if you'd like to have the mini corn dogs because <time_token_7> <time_token_8> you have several appetizers and you want people to have a variety, then you might <time_token_8> <time_token_9> use a pack like this which is called Little Smokies. This is a 14 ounce size so <time_token_9> <time_token_10> if you need about that many then that will be what this recipe will handle. Do <time_token_10> <time_token_11> you need more than just adjust your recipe? So that's what we're coming back <time_token_11> <time_token_12> to after we get our coating together. Now this is a cornmeal coating or sort of a <time_token_12> <time_token_13> cornbread type coating but it's thin and it's just the kind of coating that you <time_token_13> <time_token_14> want for a corn dog. So I'll show you how we start. Down here at the end I've <time_token_14> <time_token_15> already beaten one egg. So this is one well-beaten egg in a large mixing bowl. I <time_token_15> <time_token_16> can beat medium-sized mixing bowl. To that I'm adding some yellow cornmeal. You <time_token_16> <time_token_17> may use white cornmeal if you prefer. You need one half cup. Just put that in <time_token_17> <time_token_18> there and then I'm using all-purpose flour. I decided we'd go ahead and put <time_token_18> <time_token_19> the salt in and it doesn't need the baking powder or soda so this is going <time_token_19> <time_token_20> to be actually the best combination that you can get for the coating. One half cup <time_token_20> <time_token_21> of all-purpose flour goes in there and then we have some salt. One teaspoon of <time_token_21> <time_token_23> salt and we also have ground black pepper. One half teaspoon of ground black <time_token_23> <time_token_24> pepper and then we have milk. One half cup milk and I think at this point I <time_token_24> <time_token_25> should start mixing a little bit because the next thing that goes in is some <time_token_25> <time_token_26> melted shortening. In my case it's going to be melted butter and I don't want it <time_token_26> <time_token_27> to go directly against the eggs because it would cook the eggs. It's still very <time_token_27> <time_token_28> warm. So I'm going to blend this together and then add the shortening. <time_token_28> <time_token_29> I've mixed those dry ingredients with the egg and milk and here's the mixture <time_token_29> <time_token_30> that we have and you can see there's a little flour around the edges because I <time_token_30> <time_token_31> just wanted to get it together. I'm now going to put in some melted butter. It is <time_token_31> <time_token_32> two tablespoons of salted butter. You may use unsalted if you like. It's not <time_token_32> <time_token_33> going to make a lot of difference but we'll just put that in and stir that <time_token_33> <time_token_34> together. I'm stirring just with a spoon and then we're going to beat it a little <time_token_34> <time_token_35> bit until it's mixed completely. So it's really important that you get a fine <time_token_35> <time_token_36> mixture here so use your mixture again and mix until it's completely beaten <time_token_36> <time_token_37> together. So here's what your mixture should look like. It's a little bit thick. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> For me it's thicker than cornbread that I make but it will make a nice coating <time_token_39> <time_token_40> that way and you're more interested in it sticking to your hot dog or your <time_token_40> <time_token_41> little smoky or whatever than making nice fluffy cornbread. So just pick up <time_token_41> <time_token_42> one of these with tongs and just put it in that mixture. I'm trying to get it <time_token_42> <time_token_42> covered all the way. It kind of had it covered in the metal there where it <time_token_42> <time_token_43> couldn't get to the coating. When you get it covered bring it over somewhere <time_token_43> <time_token_44> where you can let it drain a little bit and if it doesn't drip that's fine. It <time_token_44> <time_token_45> can take that whole amount of coating but if you look at that you'll see <time_token_45> <time_token_45> there is a little bit that's dripping off of it. So I'm going to work on <time_token_45> <time_token_46> getting several of these coated and then the next step will be to take them over <time_token_46> <time_token_47> to the stove where I have some peanut oil and I'm going to heat to 350 degrees <time_token_47> <time_token_49> and when it gets to that level we'll be dropping in these mini corn dogs and <time_token_49> <time_token_49> we'll watch them cook and they will brown up in no time. We'll get them out <time_token_49> <time_token_50> and we'll drain them over here on paper towel. So that's the plan. Let me go <time_token_50> <time_token_51> ahead and get these dipped. I have one inch of peanut oil over here heating and <time_token_51> <time_token_52> it's almost a 350 degrees and I have some coated little smokies right here <time_token_53> <time_token_53> and I'll tell you I counted how many there were in the package and there were <time_token_53> <time_token_54> 34. Now if you took a pack of hot dogs if it had 12 in the pack and you divided <time_token_54> <time_token_55> them in thirds that would work and that would give you 36. So it doesn't really <time_token_55> <time_token_56> matter whether you use little smokies they're convenient or if you use hot <time_token_56> <time_token_57> dogs they just make the mini by cutting them in thirds. Here we go I think we're <time_token_57> <time_token_58> ready to drop one of these in so just use your tongs and get close to the oil <time_token_58> <time_token_59> drop it in and you'll see it float up to the top eventually and we might as well <time_token_59> <time_token_60> put a couple more in at the same time. You'll usually do these in batches so that <time_token_60> <time_token_61> they'll all come out about the same time too. Let's just do four for our <time_token_62> <time_token_63> This is a little hot. I'll get that off in just a minute. So I'm going to see what <time_token_63> <time_token_64> we have going here. These are looking good. If you have a nice spatula like <time_token_64> <time_token_66> this or a slotted spoon then it allows you to take care of a lot of them at the <time_token_66> <time_token_66> same time because you can bring them up like that. I think I let them cook just <time_token_66> <time_token_67> a little bit longer. I like them nice and tasty and brown but don't leave them too <time_token_67> <time_token_68> long and I think I might actually turn this off since I have gotten these <time_token_68> <time_token_69> ready. That gives you an idea of what you're going to be doing but I have all <time_token_69> <time_token_70> the rest of these plus the ones that I haven't coated still left to go so I'll <time_token_70> <time_token_71> see you back when they're all done. This is what your mini corn dogs will look <time_token_71> <time_token_72> like when you get them out of the deep fry oil and they're nice and crisp and <time_token_72> <time_token_72> crunchy and they're being drained here with paper towel so they won't have <time_token_72> <time_token_73> absorbed too much of that oil and then you just want to serve them on a nice <time_token_73> <time_token_74> plate and here I have a plate prepared that has some dipping mustard in the <time_token_74> <time_token_75> center and I didn't put much because I'm just going to take a taste of these and <time_token_75> <time_token_76> then Rick and I will eat a couple of them and if our daughter and family come <time_token_76> <time_token_76> over they'll want a few of them so we'll just get the mustard out as we need it. <time_token_76> <time_token_78> I prefer the Hurlockers dipping mustard as many of you know. I'm just out of it <time_token_78> <time_token_79> right now and my store doesn't carry Hurlockers dipping mustard but if you <time_token_79> <time_token_80> have a chance to try that it's really great. It's a sweet mustard but to get <time_token_80> <time_token_81> that sweetness what I'm using here is a honey mustard so feel free to use honey <time_token_81> <time_token_82> mustard or if you have another kind of mustard that is a favorite of yours <time_token_82> <time_token_83> certainly go ahead and use that but this makes a nice presentation just to put <time_token_83> <time_token_84> those in a ring around a central dip and the dip in this case <time_token_84> <time_token_85> probably is going to be something like mustard so I'll come back and test them <time_token_85> <time_token_85> for you in just a minute. <time_token_88> <time_token_90> I'm ready to test the many corn dogs and I think they've cooled down enough I <time_token_90> <time_token_91> didn't want to take a bite of one when it was just fresh out of the oil but <time_token_91> <time_token_91> we'll just take this one right here it feels warm and I'm just going to dip <time_token_91> <time_token_92> right down into the mustard so you see we have a nice bit of mustard at the end <time_token_92> <time_token_94> and I'm going to take a bite. It tastes like a sweet mustard that's good. It has a <time_token_94> <time_token_95> good crunchy outside I like the flavor of it and a little smoky taste good too <time_token_95> <time_token_95> I think you'll enjoy it ", "duration": 576.17, "segments": [[95, 172], [181, 207], [235, 252], [335, 356], [356, 400]], "seg_text": "<time_token_16> <time_token_29> <time_token_31> <time_token_35> <time_token_40> <time_token_43> <time_token_57> <time_token_61> <time_token_61> <time_token_68>", "pure_cap": "mix egg cornmeal flour salt pepper and milk. mix melted butter with the batter. coat the sausage with the batter. place the corn dogs in the oil. cook the corn dogs until brown"}, {"image_id": "iuQjb1-WAzs.mp4", "caption": "<time_token_12> <time_token_15> cook some sliced bacon with oil <time_token_18> <time_token_30> add chopped carrot celery oregano and red pepper flakes <time_token_33> <time_token_36> stir to cook it until it is soft <time_token_36> <time_token_43> add salt and pepper to the pot <time_token_43> <time_token_51> add the stock and tomato and bring it to a boil <time_token_51> <time_token_56> add beans and italian pasta <time_token_60> <time_token_67> add spinach to the soup <time_token_70> <time_token_73> add some basil and parsley", "id": 392, "seg_prompt": "139 ; 17, 22 ; 26, 43 ; 47, 51 ; 52, 61 ; 61, 72 ; 73, 79 ; 86, 95 ; 100, 104..................................................", "asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_3> Minestrone.

<time_token_9> <time_token_11> There are many variations of falafel and I'm just going to show you a simple one but you <time_token_11> <time_token_12> can look at my website for different versions. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> I've taken 250g of dried chickpeas and I've soaked them overnight. <time_token_14> <time_token_16> A word of warning, never, never, never use tinned chickpeas because this happens. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> I've got one small onion, coarsely chopped. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> Two cloves of garlic, coarsely chopped, two teaspoons each of coriander powder and cumin <time_token_28> <time_token_30> powder, a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of baking soda and half a cup of freshly <time_token_30> <time_token_32> The first thing I'm going to do is process the chickpeas and I've got a 1 litre processor <time_token_35> <time_token_35> so I'm going to do this in two batches. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Just scrape around. <time_token_38> <time_token_40> I've processed these for about a minute, quite fine in texture. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Now I'll process the other half. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> When you've processed your chickpeas, process together the onion and the garlic. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> Now add in the coriander and the herbs and spices and mix well. <time_token_50> <time_token_52> Once it's all nicely mixed, take a piece about the size of a golf ball and press it firmly <time_token_52> <time_token_53> into a ball shape. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> OK, that looks good. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> And you should be able to make about 14 or 15 falafel. <time_token_57> <time_token_59> You can shallow fry these if you like but I'm going to deep fry mine at 180 degrees <time_token_59> <time_token_59> C for about 3 minutes. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> After 3 minutes, remove from the oil and drain on some kitchen paper. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> Now that I've got my falafel, I need to make some dips. <time_token_65> <time_token_68> For my tahini sauce, I've got 6 tablespoons of tahini paste, the juice of a lemon, 1 crushed <time_token_68> <time_token_68> clove of garlic and half a teaspoon of salt. <time_token_68> <time_token_71> I'll just mix all these together and give them a good whisk. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> And you should end up with this lovely creamy dip. <time_token_73> <time_token_74> For a cucumber meat dip, start with half a cucumber. <time_token_75> <time_token_80> Peel it, cut it in half, scoop out the seeds with a teaspoon and grate the flesh. <time_token_80> <time_token_83> Put the flesh in a bowl, add in 1 crushed garlic clove, about 2 tablespoons of freshly <time_token_83> <time_token_84> chopped mint and a cup of yoghurt. <time_token_84> <time_token_87> Then mix well, season with black pepper, mix and serve. <time_token_87> <time_token_89> Falafel with a cucumber mint dip and a tahini sauce. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> Great for a supper. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> So the one great mystery that remains from all of this is whether or not Egyptian men <time_token_91> <time_token_92> are better cooks than Egyptian women. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> Or are Egyptian men simply full of f***ing s***?

My name is Isabella Morce di Vicari and I am your personal chef today <time_token_2> <time_token_3> because I'm going to teach you how to make a wonderful penne pasta with spicy vodka, <time_token_3> <time_token_4> tomato and cream sauce. So let's get started. The very first thing of course we want to <time_token_4> <time_token_5> do while we're preparing the sauce is put the water into boil and of course to cook <time_token_5> <time_token_6> rather we have a beautiful pot of rolling boiling water right here. Now remember whenever <time_token_6> <time_token_7> you put your pasta in the water, the one tip I'm going to give you, if that water doesn't <time_token_7> <time_token_8> taste like the ocean you're doing your pasta an injustice. Remember you only get one shot <time_token_8> <time_token_10> guys to make that pasta taste like it wants to be. So let's stir that up. What we're going <time_token_10> <time_token_11> to do is we're going to heat up our saute pan and I'm going to cut up some pancetta. <time_token_11> <time_token_13> Now pancetta is like an Italian bacon. You need about a quarter pound. You noticed I <time_token_13> <time_token_14> have this actually sliced and there's no rhyme or reason on how it has to be. Alright whatever <time_token_14> <time_token_15> is easier for you. If you want to separate it because it's easier for you to do it that <time_token_15> <time_token_17> way by all means. We're going to put the sponchetta in the saute pan very shortly. As a matter <time_token_17> <time_token_18> of fact let's get that butter in. You want two tablespoons of butter. Here's one and <time_token_18> <time_token_20> two. Oops put that in there. Now we need the olive oil because the olive oil is going to <time_token_20> <time_token_22> keep the butter from burning. So let me just melt that down. Perfect and I'm going to throw <time_token_22> <time_token_25> the pancetta in right now. Got a little more to go. Okay perfect. You want to lower that <time_token_25> <time_token_26> a little bit because you don't want to burn it because you want to cook this but you want <time_token_26> <time_token_27> it nice and crispy. While I'm here let's make sure you serve that pasta. Remember no mushy <time_token_27> <time_token_29> pasta and my kuchina or yours for that matter. Okay as I have this nice and low I'm going to <time_token_29> <time_token_31> leave this here. Alright let's chop some onions. As the pancetta is cooking getting it nice and <time_token_31> <time_token_32> crisp. You want to take an onion. I had a really large onion and I did do that whole thing so I <time_token_32> <time_token_34> just cut it in half and all we're going to do is we're just going to chop it. That doesn't have to <time_token_34> <time_token_35> be so fine. You're going to learn in my style of cooking that cooking is not scientific at all. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> I don't get myself crazy on how big the pieces are. They don't have to be exact. I just want them <time_token_36> <time_token_37> in there and they're almost the same. There you go. You notice I got another piece that I need to <time_token_37> <time_token_38> let go so I'm going to leave this right here. Notice I also have my fresh tomato sauce that I <time_token_38> <time_token_39> made earlier. I have some wonderful parsley because we're going to need that. So you know <time_token_39> <time_token_40> what while that pancetta is cooking let's take a nice handful of fresh parsley <time_token_40> <time_token_42> and let's chop that up too. You know how I feel about herbs. By the way you know I always teach <time_token_42> <time_token_44> you a word or two in Italian so I'm going to teach you how to say parsley and parsley in Italian is <time_token_44> <time_token_45> prezemolo. I'm going to say it one more time. Prezemolo. Thank you. So here we go we got our parsley <time_token_45> <time_token_46> we have our onions chopped that pancetta is ready and we're going to add the wonderful chopped onions <time_token_46> <time_token_49> that we just took care of. Chipola. That's how you say onions chipola. All right. Ah the smells <time_token_49> <time_token_50> heavenly. I love the smell of pancetta. Oh it's fabulous. It's nice and crispy and it has that <time_token_50> <time_token_51> wonderful saltiness to it. Let's get my herbs over. I want my fresh tomato sauce <time_token_52> <time_token_53> and my prezemolo. Remember how I taught you how to say that in Italian? <time_token_53> <time_token_53> I'm going to leave it right here. Perfect. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Now well where's the vodka? Right here my friends right here. Let's put it in right now. <time_token_56> <time_token_57> Don't you love that sound? <time_token_57> <time_token_58> We're going to throw that in. We're going to throw the fresh tomato sauce in. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Ah doesn't this look beautiful? Do you notice that it takes no time at all to make these dishes? <time_token_60> <time_token_61> And of course we're going to need the cream but not just yet. <time_token_61> <time_token_62> Now I know that pasta is ready. I'm going to turn this off <time_token_63> <time_token_63> and we're going to drain it. <time_token_63> <time_token_65> Okay we're going to drain this pasta right now. Now while we're draining don't forget to put about <time_token_65> <time_token_66> a cup of the reserved pasta water aside because you never know when you're going to need it to <time_token_66> <time_token_67> stretch that sauce just a little bit. Okay I'm going to leave it right here. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> Part of a moment. Now what are we doing? We added the vodka. We added the fresh tomatoes. I'm going <time_token_69> <time_token_71> to add the cream now. Now I like using half and half. Many people use heavy cream. I prefer to <time_token_71> <time_token_72> make this as healthy as possible. So I'm going to use the half and half. What else am I going to do? <time_token_72> <time_token_73> I'm going to add these beautiful herbs in. Toss that in and last but not least <time_token_73> <time_token_74> I'm going to taste this before we throw this pasta in. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> Can you see how beautiful this looks? Ah this looks gorgeous. <time_token_77> <time_token_79> That is simply delicioso. But you know what? I like a kick. We're going to throw a little more <time_token_79> <time_token_80> red pepper in this baby. We're going to stir it up and now we're going to take that pasta and take <time_token_80> <time_token_81> it and toss it right in just like this. Now let me tell you a restaurant trick. <time_token_81> <time_token_83> You never ever ever sauce the pasta in the bowl that you're serving it in. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> You always want to sauce the pasta right here in the pan because what you want to do is you want <time_token_84> <time_token_86> these flavors to marry. You want them to just come together and you're going to see what happens. If <time_token_86> <time_token_87> you let this simmer just for a few moments it'll be perfect. All right here we go. I want you to <time_token_87> <time_token_88> see this gorgeous, gorgeous spicy penne pasta. You're going to love it with vodka and pancetta <time_token_88> <time_token_89> and herbs and a touch of cream. You notice that it's not heavy at all. Watch this. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> To me this is a fabulous dish and how long did it take? Not very long at all. The only thing I <time_token_91> <time_token_92> would do is add a little bit of Romano cheese. Okay a little more because I like my Romano <time_token_92> <time_token_93> and of course I'm going to taste it one more time and I want you to see. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> That's amazing. Your family's going to want this for dinner. Remember chef Isabella's Isabella <time_token_96> <time_token_97> Cucina, Ben Binotti, and Vivre Beni Amici. Live well my friends and bon appetito. Ciao.

Today on Divas Can Cook, we are making a BLT Caesar Pasta Salad. I don't even want to let you guys know how many bowls I've had of this stuff. It is like, it's so sad. It's so sad. But let me show you how to make it. <time_token_9> <time_token_16> Okay, we're going to start by making our pasta. I'm using the mini bowl type pastas because they're so cute! You want to bring that water to a boil and a little salt there and toss them in. <time_token_16> <time_token_19> We're going to cook these into their al dente. I like saying that. It's not going to keep you fine. Al dente? <time_token_19> <time_token_28> Okay, so these are perfectly cooked. Go ahead and drain them and then rinse them off with cold water. Place them in a bowl. There they are nice and cooled off. I love the way it feels. So nice, so nice. <time_token_28> <time_token_36> Okay, now we're going to work on our bacon. I'm using turkey bacon. You can use whatever kind you like. Go ahead and fry those bad boys up. Okay, just like that. <time_token_36> <time_token_39> Then we're going to remove them and let them drain a little bit. I like my bacon kind of burnt. I don't know why. I kind of like burnt bacon. <time_token_39> <time_token_44> And don't forget you guys, you can find this recipe on my blog, TheWhistleCooked.com, with a ton of other recipes. So go check that out. <time_token_44> <time_token_49> Alright, now it's the fun part. Let's put this salad together. Okay, we're going to add in our bacon. I crumbled it up just like that. <time_token_49> <time_token_54> Okay, next we're going to add in our, we're going to toss it around a bit. Make sure we have enough bacon. I like a lot of bacon, so I add a lot. <time_token_54> <time_token_61> Next we're going to add in our chopped up cherry tomatoes. Yum, seeds and all. Next come some black olives. I love black olives, so I add a lot. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> But you can add a little, a lot, whatever. Okay. <time_token_63> <time_token_70> And then we're going to add in a really good quality Caesar dressing. You can make your own or pick some up in the, I think I got that in the produce section, the refrigerated section. <time_token_70> <time_token_72> Don't get the kind that's not refrigerated. Ew, it's disgusting. <time_token_72> <time_token_77> Alright, now we're going to add in some romaine lettuce. The lettuce, I was really surprised that the lettuce tastes so good in this dish. <time_token_77> <time_token_82> It makes it taste so fresh and just crunchy. It works so good. I love it. So go ahead and add your lettuce in there. <time_token_82> <time_token_87> And then we're going to add in some shredded parmesan cheese. Sprinkle that in there a lot or a little, just whatever you like. <time_token_87> <time_token_91> Now just toss it all around and guess what you guys, we are done. Yay!

Frying your pancetta or smoked streaky <time_token_9> <time_token_10> bacon in the butter is going to bring out so much flavor it has this wonderful salty taste <time_token_10> <time_token_12> if you can't get pancetta smoked streaky bacon just cut up nice and fine is perfect and does <time_token_12> <time_token_14> the job so in with that I have some nice chunky stuff here and you just want to fry it down until <time_token_14> <time_token_17> you get a nice sizzling golden color this has to be one of the most simple pasta dishes you will <time_token_17> <time_token_18> ever make it takes literally about 10 minutes you will have the sauce done in the time it takes to <time_token_18> <time_token_20> cook the pasta I already have mine done while the bacon or the pancetta is frying off I'm just going <time_token_20> <time_token_23> to add in a little sprinkle of dried chili flakes now you don't need to use these if you don't want <time_token_23> <time_token_25> to but if you like a bit of heat get them in there. Now the reason this recipe gets its name <time_token_25> <time_token_27> is because you add vodka to the sauce now it sounds like a bit of a strange addition here but <time_token_27> <time_token_29> the use of vodka in here intensifies the tomato sauce and kind of brings out the sweetness in <time_token_29> <time_token_31> there so it does have its uses I'm going to add about four tablespoons into the pan here and if <time_token_31> <time_token_32> you're cooking this for young people remember the alcohol is going to burn off so don't worry too <time_token_32> <time_token_34> much about it so four tablespoons go in here it will sizzle it will fizz but don't worry about it <time_token_34> <time_token_38> it just needs to cook out just for luck so once that has sizzled away you want to get about three <time_token_38> <time_token_41> or four tablespoons worth of tomato puree in here all these things you can have on hand and they <time_token_41> <time_token_43> literally just get thrown together to make a delicious meal. Once you have that tomato puree <time_token_43> <time_token_45> nicely mixed through what you need to add in is some double cream it is quite a heavy dish but <time_token_45> <time_token_47> you know what it is so creamy and delicious once you put this in it's worth it so pour that in <time_token_47> <time_token_48> and just mix it all through you want to bring it up to just a kind of nice simmer and then we're <time_token_48> <time_token_51> going to add our pasta in. So in alongside this lovely sauce I'm going to tumble the pasta with <time_token_51> <time_token_53> some parmesan cheese and some parsley so give it a good grate on a microplane grater like this <time_token_53> <time_token_54> and you want to look for parmesano reggiano it's the best stuff. <time_token_55> <time_token_58> Take a good handful of flat leaf parsley like this and just rip off the stalks and put them <time_token_58> <time_token_59> to one side and you should be left with a nice bit of leafage there and just roll this into a <time_token_59> <time_token_61> nice ball and you kind of want to give it a rough chop you don't have to be too careful here but <time_token_61> <time_token_62> it's lovely to get flecks of green in here and because it's such a rich sauce it needs that <time_token_62> <time_token_66> freshness from the herbs. Lovely. I've got a big bowl of penne pasta which I've cooked up and <time_token_66> <time_token_67> drained and now it's ready to be added straight into the sauce. Just give it a really good mix <time_token_67> <time_token_69> through just so that the pasta is all completely coated and then just dump in that parmesan cheese <time_token_69> <time_token_72> lovely parmesan cheese and also some of that wonderful parsley in there as well this is going <time_token_72> <time_token_74> to be absolutely delicious. Just mix it all through and this is ready to rock a perfect <time_token_74> <time_token_79> little 15 minute meal that will blow your mind. A last little bit of parmesan cheese and flat <time_token_79> <time_token_81> leaf parsley over the top and check this out a mega little pasta dish this is my vodka penne <time_token_81>

"<time_token_0> <time_token_2> Hello, this is Chef John from foodwishes.com with the world's fastest meatballs. <time_token_2> <time_token_4> That's right, I'm going to show you an incredibly fast no-chop meatball mixture, but wait, that's <time_token_4> <time_token_6> Not only is this a no-chop meatball recipe, it's a no-roll meatball recipe. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> And yet with all those shortcuts, it's still incredibly delicious, and this is how you <time_token_8> <time_token_9> Okay, so the best part about a no-chop meatball recipe is the no-chopping part. <time_token_9> <time_token_11> So you're just going to take some ground beef and ground veal. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> By the way, you can use any combination of beef, veal, and pork. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> So I crumble that in a bowl, alright, and then in a small bowl I'm going to take some <time_token_13> <time_token_15> plain breadcrumbs, I'm going to add some milk, one whole egg, some dry Italian herbs, have <time_token_15> <time_token_17> a little touch of granulated garlic, a little splash of olive oil, a big pinch of red pepper <time_token_17> <time_token_18> flakes, and then we're going to mix that together with a whisk. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> By the way, instead of calling this the wet breadcrumb mixture, we call it a slurry. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> It's shorter and sounds more official. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> So when your slurries mix, set that aside, and it's back to the bowl of meat, which we're <time_token_22> <time_token_24> now going to season with salt, black pepper, and for me just a little pinch of white pepper. <time_token_24> <time_token_25> And if you don't have it, that's fine. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> After the salt and pepper, I'm going to add some Parmesan cheese, the real stuff from <time_token_26> <time_token_28> Alright, at that point you're going to transfer your slurry mixture into the meatball, and <time_token_28> <time_token_29> you're going to give it a good mix. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> And for my next trick, I'm going to turn a wooden spoon into a rubber spatula in 3, 2... <time_token_31> <time_token_32> Alright, so we're going to mix that together. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> Stop worrying about over mixing. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> This meatball recipe is indestructible. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> So I'm not saying intentionally over mix it, but once it's mixed, stop. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> So right there I'm good. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> I'm going to stop and begin to shape the meatballs. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> But before we shape them, I'm going to need you to line a baking sheet with some aluminum <time_token_38> <time_token_39> foil and then brush it lightly with oil. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> And then, for the most time-consuming step in making meatballs, the rolling. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> Except we're not going to roll. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> We're going to scoop. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> Besides being fast because it's no chop, this method uses a scoop instead of rolling. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> So you're just going to take one of these small sorbet scoops. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> They sell them at every kitchen supply store. <time_token_45> <time_token_47> And by using this, you can scoop a whole tray like that in about 5 minutes, and you're going <time_token_47> <time_token_49> to get the same basic shape except they're going to have extra nooks and crannies, which <time_token_49> <time_token_49> is an advantage. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> All right, ask anybody that slices sandwich meat. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> Surface area equals flavor, okay? <time_token_51> <time_token_51> So I know they're a little rough around the edges. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> In fact, I have like a pet nickname for them. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> I call these my rough riders. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> And yes, I've heard through the grapevine that DMX is not happy about that, but that's <time_token_54> <time_token_55> And this method really does save a tremendous amount of time. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> So we're going to scoop all that out. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> It should fit on one sheet tray. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> Once they're scooped, we have to brown them. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> This can also be a time-consuming step. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Some people fry, some people bake. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> We're going to go even faster. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> You're simply going to brown those under a hot broiler. <time_token_60> <time_token_62> It's going to take like half the time that baking or frying would. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> And as soon as they're browned, you're done. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Now if you're not interested in the world's fastest meatballs but are fine with one of <time_token_64> <time_token_66> the world's fastest meatballs, you can flip these over and brown the other side if desired. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> I didn't, but feel free. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Now ideally as your meatballs were browning, you already had a pot of pasta sauce on the <time_token_68> <time_token_69> stove, already hot. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> You're going to transfer your meatballs in, and as soon as that comes back to a simmer, <time_token_70> <time_token_71> you're ready to eat. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> So if your sauce is already hot, start to finish. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> You can do this recipe in about 35, 40 minutes, okay? <time_token_73> <time_token_75> And of course if you have an extra 15, 20 minutes, maybe a half hour, let the meatballs <time_token_75> <time_token_75> simmer in the sauce a little bit. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> It's only going to make the sauce more flavorful. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> So don't worry about overcooking the meatballs or them getting tough. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Not going to happen, okay? <time_token_78> <time_token_78> And you know how this story ends, right? <time_token_78> <time_token_80> We put it over spaghetti, we top it with some extra parmesan, and we dig in. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> There you go. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> The world's fastest meatballs, like I said, despite saving all that time with the no chopping, <time_token_83> <time_token_84> and the no rolling, and the no frying or baking, it still comes out amazing. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> And you'll have to take my word for that, but these were really good. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> A fabulous plate of spaghetti meatballs. <time_token_86> <time_token_88> Of course it's not going to be as epic as the traditional methods, but it's not supposed <time_token_88> <time_token_89> This is like a weeknight, you're craving spaghetti meatballs, but you don't have hours <time_token_89> <time_token_90> and hours to spend. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> This is a great alternative. <time_token_90> <time_token_91> So I hope you give it a try. <time_token_91> <time_token_93> Head over to foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts and

So here in a bowl I'm going to put two and half cups of all-purpose <time_token_16> <time_token_21> flour, add 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 to 2 teaspoon oil and yeast. We're going to put it right into the <time_token_21> <time_token_27> floor and salt to taste and quarter cup of plain yogurt at room temperature. Make sure it's at room <time_token_27> <time_token_32> temperature. Now I'm going to knead the dough using the KitchenAid stand mixer. Add a little <time_token_32> <time_token_34> water at a time and also make sure the water is little bit lukewarm. It will help the dough rise <time_token_34> <time_token_42> faster. We want to make a soft dough softer than normal chapati atta. Now take the dough out in a <time_token_42> <time_token_46> separate bowl and let it rise. Leave it for 30 to 40 minutes in a warm place. So after 30 minutes you <time_token_46> <time_token_49> can see the dough is almost double in the size and now we are ready to prepare the naan. So grease <time_token_49> <time_token_52> your palms with a little bit of oil to prevent the dough from sticking and take a desired amount <time_token_52> <time_token_55> depending on how big or small you want the naan to be and now dip it in a loose flour and we are <time_token_55> <time_token_63> going to roll it with the help of rolling pin. Sprinkle some loose flour if it's sticking. Now <time_token_63> <time_token_66> heat a pan or a griddle and we are going to put the naan on the griddle and keep it on a medium <time_token_66> <time_token_70> heat. Cover it and let it cook for about two to three minutes. Now as you can see it has a lot <time_token_70> <time_token_74> of bubbles so it is puffing up just fine. Now the one side is done for the other side I'm just going <time_token_74> <time_token_76> to flip it over the flame directly keeping it little bit above the flame so it doesn't burn <time_token_76> <time_token_79> but puffs up right. So keep flipping it over until it's nicely done. <time_token_82> <time_token_86> So the naan is ready. Now top it off with the butter. If you want to make a garlic naan just <time_token_86> <time_token_89> spread a garlic paste and sprinkle some fresh coriander but for my butter naan I'm just going <time_token_89> <time_token_93> to sprinkle some kasoori methi for extra flavor. And here the naan is ready. Enjoy it with your <time_token_93> <time_token_97> favorite curry. Thank you for watching.

<time_token_29> <time_token_32> Some fresh parmesan or pecorino romano cheese, or a combination of both. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> I think 50-50 is perfect. <time_token_33> <time_token_35> So we're going to put our grated cheese in there, whisk that up, and set that aside. <time_token_35> <time_token_38> All right, our bacon is cooked, or hopefully in your case, guanciale or pancetta. <time_token_39> <time_token_41> When it looks like that, we're going to turn that down to low as it goes, and we're going <time_token_41> <time_token_41> to put on our pasta to boil. <time_token_41> <time_token_44> Now the pasta water is an important aspect of this sauce, so we're going to use that <time_token_44> <time_token_45> water as the pasta cooks to finish this sauce. <time_token_45> <time_token_47> So what you want to do, and by the way, I'm making this for two people. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> So I have about six ounces of raw pasta in there. <time_token_48> <time_token_51> So I'm going to take about a cup of that pasta water and add it to my pan, and again, that's <time_token_51> <time_token_52> just on as low a heat as it goes. <time_token_52> <time_token_55> Once the pasta's cooked, I'm going to drain it and toss it with that black pepper-bacon <time_token_55> <time_token_57> By the way, if you're wondering why that looks kind of dark, I'm using a whole grain <time_token_57> <time_token_59> of vanilla plus pasta, which I love. <time_token_59> <time_token_61> Once that's mixed, drizzle in your egg cheese mixture, so you're going to stir in the egg. <time_token_61> <time_token_65> It's going to hit that hot pasta, and it's going to form a really creamy, rich, but not <time_token_66> <time_token_68> All right, as soon as it's combined like that, turn off the heat, throw in your cheese. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> I'm using half pecorino romano, half reggiano parmesan. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> Mix it around, and you're ready to eat. <time_token_71> <time_token_73> So anyway, that's my version of authentic spaghetti carbonara. <time_token_73> <time_token_75> Like I said, smoked bacon, not the best choice. <time_token_75> <time_token_77> It works in a pinch, but try to find some pancetta, and I think you're going to like <time_token_77> <time_token_78> this even more without that smoky flavor. <time_token_78> <time_token_80> It can be a little overpowering, and if you want to serve, of course, a little more black <time_token_80> <time_token_81> pepper and a little grated cheese. <time_token_81> <time_token_83> And by the way, the name carbonara, or at least the story I believe, the name comes <time_token_83> <time_token_86> from all those little specks of black pepper look like carbon, and since this used to be <time_token_86> <time_token_89> served to coal miners, it all makes sense, kind of a double entendre, which is not telling <time_token_90> <time_token_90> Okay, now I'm just confusing myself. <time_token_91> <time_token_93> Anyway, all the ingredients are on the site if you want to give that a try, and as always, ", "duration": 190.17, "segments": [[24, 50], [53, 71], [82, 94], [94, 101], [105, 114], [114, 128], [128, 143]], "seg_text": "<time_token_12> <time_token_26> <time_token_27> <time_token_36> <time_token_42> <time_token_48> <time_token_48> <time_token_52> <time_token_54> <time_token_59> <time_token_59> <time_token_66> <time_token_66> <time_token_74>", "pure_cap": "cook bacon in a pot with oil and pepper. mix eggs black pepper and cheese together. cook the pasta in boiling water. add water from the pasta to the pan with bacon. add the pasta to the pan. mix in the egg mixture. mix in cheese"}, {"image_id": "i9CMFh31Bs0.mp4", "caption": "<time_token_24> <time_token_32> finely chop a cabbage to small pieces <time_token_38> <time_token_44> add 20g salt caraway seeds juniper berries and dill <time_token_48> <time_token_52> massage the cabbage with the seasoning <time_token_62> <time_token_82> put the mixture in a jar and press firm to the bottom <time_token_85> <time_token_89> seal the jar and put in dark place for 4 weeks", "id": 401, "seg_prompt": "616 ; 151, 204 ; 242, 279 ; 301, 326 ; 387, 514 ; 531, 555..........................................................", "asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_1> Hi, this is Sarah Hopkins. You might have seen some of my previous videos and today <time_token_1> <time_token_2> what I want to do is share one of my favorite recipes and in my opinion, one of the most <time_token_2> <time_token_3> healthiest and beneficial recipes around. So you may have heard about fermented foods. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> They seem to be a bit of a trending topic at the moment and that's because most of us <time_token_4> <time_token_5> have a pretty poorly run digestive system due to excessive alcohol consumption, coffee <time_token_5> <time_token_6> consumption and antibiotics especially. So what fermented foods do is really repopulate <time_token_6> <time_token_7> the gut. So really allow the gut to heal and allow the right population of healthy gut <time_token_7> <time_token_7> flora to repopulate that gut again and to get things working. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> Sauerkraut is a really simple recipe to make so I thought that that would be a great one <time_token_8> <time_token_9> to start with because it's really easy. Everybody can do it. It's also super cost effective. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> You can buy sauerkraut but it's quite expensive. All it takes is a cabbage and some salt. So <time_token_10> <time_token_11> I'll take you through the process today and hopefully you can incorporate this into your <time_token_11> <time_token_11> diet on a daily basis. <time_token_11> <time_token_13> So the first thing that we need is a cabbage. Always has to be organic. Organic is really <time_token_13> <time_token_14> important. Foods that are not organic, when they ferment, they're basically sort of increasing <time_token_14> <time_token_15> that toxicity of whatever the pesticides are that are present on the food. So organic is <time_token_15> <time_token_15> really important which is obviously going to cost a little bit more but it's a worthwhile <time_token_15> <time_token_16> investment for your health. So a cabbage. A good quality fermenting jar is important <time_token_16> <time_token_17> and the one that I've got here is called a Fowler's Vacola. You can use like the clip <time_token_17> <time_token_19> lock jars but I would recommend looking into a Fowler's Vacola. Good quality sea salt. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> So again it's really important to get a good quality naturally sourced sea salt. We don't <time_token_20> <time_token_21> want any refined salts. They're not going to allow the fermentation process to occur <time_token_21> <time_token_22> adequately. And then you just want some seasoning. So the seasoning I'm going to use today is <time_token_22> <time_token_23> caraway seeds, juniper berries and some dill tips and we'll have a look. So what we're <time_token_23> <time_token_25> going to do is we're going to start with chopping the cabbage finely. And by the way, be careful <time_token_25> <time_token_26> with the knife otherwise you'll cut yourself like I did. So I find the best way to chop <time_token_26> <time_token_27> the cabbage shown to me by a good friend very recently is into quarters and then it's easy <time_token_27> <time_token_29> to get that core out. There we go. So then we're going to chop the cabbage. You can use <time_token_29> <time_token_30> a mandolin to do this. It does make it easier. So you want to chop it relatively finely watching <time_token_30> <time_token_32> out for those fingers. So hopefully you can see from this roughly how finely you want it to chop. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> So we pop the whole cabbage finely chopped into a nice big bowl. Bowl needs to be a fairly good <time_token_34> <time_token_35> size. And then we want to add the salt. So the salt is going to help release the brine which <time_token_35> <time_token_36> is going to allow the lacto fermentation process which is providing all that beautiful bacteria <time_token_36> <time_token_38> that is going to heal I got. So the rule of thumb with salt is that you want about 2.5 to 3% of the <time_token_38> <time_token_39> weight of the cabbage. So in this case we've got about 20 grams. So I've weighed that out. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> I'm going to add that in. Then I'm going to add my spices or seasonings in. So <time_token_40> <time_token_41> probably for this cabbage which was about 800-ish grams I'm going to use about a teaspoon. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> And then I'm using probably about a teaspoon of juniper berries as well. <time_token_43> <time_token_44> Dill tips. Dill can be quite strong. So maybe half a teaspoon. I do have some fresh dill <time_token_44> <time_token_45> in the garden. If you do have fresh dill I would recommend using that. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> Now for the fun part. What you want to do is we really need to release all of the juices from <time_token_46> <time_token_47> this cabbage because they're really making the core sort of constituents of this whole <time_token_47> <time_token_49> fermentation process. So it's called a brine. So now we're going to get in and really mix that salt. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> Into the cabbage which is going to take about 10 minutes. <time_token_50> <time_token_52> So really work it. It's a good workout. You really want to squeeze that <time_token_52> <time_token_53> cabbage. I like to call it mastication because it's like you're using your hands to chew the <time_token_53> <time_token_54> cabbage. Mastication is chewing. So you're really masticating that cabbage to really release all <time_token_54> <time_token_55> that. See all that beautiful brine. So that's all of that brine. That's the sort of sugar and starch <time_token_55> <time_token_56> containing the vegetable that will allow the fermentation process to occur. So now it's sort <time_token_56> <time_token_57> of it takes probably about 10 minutes for it to really get to this level of brininess. And you <time_token_57> <time_token_58> can see that it's really soft and briny and all those herbs are blended in. And the most important <time_token_58> <time_token_59> thing that you put in there is love. So make sure that you you know give it lots of love and really <time_token_59> <time_token_60> massage, massage all of your goodness into it. And now we're going to place it into our fermenting jar <time_token_60> <time_token_62> which I am a little bit uncoordinated at but that's okay. So <time_token_62> <time_token_63> this is also sort of part of the an important part of the process. So we need to make sure <time_token_63> <time_token_64> that we're packing that cabbage in really, really tight because the cabbage needs to be entirely <time_token_64> <time_token_65> covered by brine for the fermentation process to occur in the best possible environment. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> So really, really punching it down and we've got lots of brine in the bottom here so it's going to be <time_token_67> <time_token_69> really well covered. And obviously it's important to wash your hands before you do this. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> That seems like a pretty obvious thing to do. But just to make sure that you're getting the <time_token_70> <time_token_71> right bacteria in there and not anything else that you might have been touching. And if you are <time_token_71> <time_token_72> squeamish about that you can use some rubber gloves. I've obviously got a rubber finger <time_token_72> <time_token_73> for where I've cut myself but you can use you know well-fitting rubber gloves. But I think you know <time_token_73> <time_token_74> there's something to be said for really getting in contact with and having some personal connection <time_token_74> <time_token_75> back to our food which again is really sort of playing into that whole paleo piece you know. It's <time_token_75> <time_token_76> about getting back to our natural roots and our ancestors always fermented food and they always <time_token_76> <time_token_77> use their fingers and hands to eat and touch and prepare their food. And so I personally think that <time_token_77> <time_token_78> using your hands is the best way to prepare a really good healthy robust sauerkraut. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> Okay so we've got lots of beautiful brine and we're going to push that down <time_token_79> <time_token_80> so that it covers. We're going to really jam it in so that it's nice and tight. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> And actually that's probably the right height. You want to leave a little bit of room because <time_token_81> <time_token_82> when it starts to ferment it can actually start to bubble. As you can see here there is a little <time_token_82> <time_token_83> bit of bubbling going on. So you want to make sure that you do have about that width between <time_token_84> <time_token_84> sort of the top of the brine and then the lid. So now we're going to place the lid on. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> So this particular fermenting jar and all good fermenting jars should be creating an anaerobic <time_token_85> <time_token_87> environment so no oxygen. That's the idea. So with this particular jar make sure that the <time_token_87> <time_token_88> rubber band is fitted correctly around the outside and then pop <time_token_88> <time_token_89> that lid on it. And I like to line it up with the line that's on the top of the lid. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> And there you have it. Beautiful amazingly healthy jar of sauerkraut which is amazing for <time_token_91> <time_token_92> healthy gut flora and also tastes absolutely delicious. So I'm going to leave that now in <time_token_92> <time_token_93> a dark place so probably in my pantry for up to four weeks in this particular jar. So I'll <time_token_93> <time_token_94> probably leave this for somewhere between two to four weeks to really allow the optimal fermentation <time_token_94> <time_token_95> process to occur and after that it can be popped into the fridge or popped into another jar and <time_token_95> <time_token_96> enjoyed you know as a condiment once a day or twice a day if you feel like it to really help <time_token_96> <time_token_97> reconstitute the gut flora and improve your health.

Glenn the Ball Chef and this evening we're going to be putting <time_token_1> <time_token_2> together an appetizer recipe for calamari. <time_token_3> <time_token_4> This is just fried squid ringlets. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> It's pretty easy to put together and I'm going to show you the step by step instructions <time_token_6> <time_token_6> on how to do just such. <time_token_6> <time_token_7> Now if you're going to make calamari, what you're going to need to do is get fresh squid <time_token_8> <time_token_8> Don't buy the ringlets. <time_token_8> <time_token_8> Go ahead and get the squid. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> Take the tentacles off. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> Remove the little spiny piece of cartilage that's inside the squid and remove all of <time_token_11> <time_token_11> I've done that with these squids. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> Try to get the smallest squids possible because they are the tasty. <time_token_12> <time_token_14> What we're going to do is after you've cleaned these pieces of squid out, you're just going <time_token_14> <time_token_15> to cut these into ringlets. <time_token_15> <time_token_15> It's real simple. <time_token_16> <time_token_19> One thing to keep in mind is that you're going to want to cut these into about half <time_token_19> <time_token_21> I'm going to go ahead and prepare all of these pieces of squid I've got and I'll take you <time_token_21> <time_token_21> to the next step. <time_token_21> <time_token_23> I have now cleaned all of my squid up, cut it up and I've got it on a paper towel drawing <time_token_23> <time_token_27> I've taken three quarters of a cup of just all purpose flour and a quarter cup of cornmeal. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> I'm going to add one egg to that. <time_token_28> <time_token_30> Then we're going to place three quarters of a cup of warm water into this mixture. <time_token_30> <time_token_32> Now I'm going to stir this up into a batter and when I've done such, I'll come back and <time_token_32> <time_token_32> show you the next step. <time_token_32> <time_token_34> Now that I have prepared my batter, it's going to be pretty liquidy, but that's okay. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> We're going to put all of the squid into the batter first. <time_token_36> <time_token_41> Once we have the squid immersed into the unseasoned batter, give it a little bit of a stir and <time_token_42> <time_token_43> we'll set that aside and I'll show you the next step. <time_token_43> <time_token_45> The next step in this battering process is we're going to put in one cup of panko breadcrumbs. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> These are Japanese breadcrumbs that are nice, light and fluffy. <time_token_47> <time_token_49> Put that right into this bowl and to that I'm going to add one and a quarter tablespoon <time_token_49> <time_token_50> of cayenne pepper. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> I want these spicy. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> If you don't like spicy, don't put the cayenne pepper in there. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> We're going to add some salt, just about a teaspoon or so. <time_token_52> <time_token_55> The panko flakes that I've got do not have any salt in them, so we do want to put a little <time_token_55> <time_token_55> bit of salt in there. <time_token_55> <time_token_57> The last spice we're going to use is about a teaspoon of white pepper. <time_token_57> <time_token_60> What we simply want to do now is thoroughly mix the dry ingredients together and then <time_token_60> <time_token_61> once that's accomplished we're going to bread up our squid. <time_token_61> <time_token_63> Now what we're going to do is we're going to spider out our squid from the batter that <time_token_63> <time_token_66> they were sitting in and then we're going to mix those in with the panko breadcrumbs <time_token_66> <time_token_67> to thoroughly coat the calamari. <time_token_67> <time_token_69> And what we're going to want to do then remove those and set those onto a paper towel and <time_token_69> <time_token_69> rebatch the rest. <time_token_69> <time_token_73> Now our next step is we're going to take and put our panko infused calamari into a <time_token_74> <time_token_75> We're going to shake that a little bit, take off some of that extra breading and then what <time_token_75> <time_token_77> we've done here is we've taken a deep fat fryer, we've put in some vegetable oil that <time_token_77> <time_token_78> we've brought up to 350 degrees. <time_token_78> <time_token_81> We're going to drop our calamari right into the pot oil, we'll put the top on this so <time_token_81> <time_token_82> that it doesn't splatter over everything and in about five minutes we'll come back and <time_token_82> <time_token_83> take a look. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Alright, these have fried up nice and golden brown, we can go ahead and remove them from <time_token_84> <time_token_87> the oil and we will put them right over onto a piece of paper towel. <time_token_87> <time_token_88> Alright folks, there is the completed calamari appetizer recipe. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Let's give one of these little critters a try here. <time_token_89> <time_token_91> I've got some marinara sauce, you can dip it in that, go with the lemon. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> I just wanted to see what one of these tastes like on nacharau. <time_token_92> <time_token_94> Very very tender, juicy, don't go with those large pieces of squid, they're very rubbery. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> This is a very nice dish for an appetizer if you're a seafood lover, you need to give <time_token_95> <time_token_95> this one a try. <time_token_95> <time_token_97> Thanks for watching me put together this recipe this evening, give me a like if you <time_token_97> <time_token_97> like what you see, if you don't, tell me why. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> Thanks for

<time_token_62> <time_token_62> Then you can smell them. <time_token_63> <time_token_63> And then add the sauce. <time_token_69> <time_token_70> Time for the shrimp. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> And the tofu. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> Also the mushroom. <time_token_74> <time_token_74> And the string. <time_token_75> <time_token_76> You don't need to add more water because there's still water in the tofu and mushroom. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Now just cut it. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> And then wait for around 5 to 10 minutes. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> So do you think it's done cooking? <time_token_80> <time_token_80> I think so. <time_token_82> <time_token_82> How do you know if it's finished? <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Well, you can see the little hole in the tofu. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> That means it's okay now. <time_token_84> <time_token_84> You see that? <time_token_85> <time_token_86> At the end of this, we just add some green onion because the color is still important <time_token_86> <time_token_87> in Chinese food. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> And now a little salt. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> Not too much. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> Here, I want to thank you so much for showing us how to make this recipe today. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> It looks delicious. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> Let's try it. <time_token_96> <time_token_97> Follow the link below to our blog to download the recipe and the grocery list. <time_token_97> <time_token_98> Try this recipe at home and post a photo on Instagram and tag us at MyTRU.

show of hands, who here loves Caesar salad? <time_token_2> <time_token_2> I love it. <time_token_2> <time_token_4> I order it all the time when I go out to restaurants and you know sometimes it's great <time_token_4> <time_token_4> and sometimes it's not so great. <time_token_4> <time_token_6> Today I'm making a version that's a little bit lower fat and it's a chicken Caesar which <time_token_6> <time_token_6> is a perennial favorite I think. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> First what you do is you marinate your chicken and you make the base for your dressing. <time_token_8> <time_token_10> So it's sort of a two for one, one and a half cups of buttermilk with two tablespoons of <time_token_10> <time_token_12> The chicken can marinate for as little as 15 minutes but you can make this ahead of <time_token_12> <time_token_12> time if you want to, up to a day. <time_token_12> <time_token_13> Two tablespoons of lemon juice, one clove of garlic. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> Today I'm using a garlic press. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> I like the small size that you get with the garlic press here. <time_token_15> <time_token_17> Classic Caesar salads are actually made by mashing garlic with anchovies and then whisking <time_token_17> <time_token_18> in egg yolk and olive oil. <time_token_18> <time_token_20> I'm replacing my egg yolk with mayonnaise and I'm leaving out the anchovy but please <time_token_20> <time_token_21> feel free to add it in if you want to. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> A quarter cup of grated parmesan cheese. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> This cheese is going to go into the marinade but it's also going into the dressing. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> Salt and pepper. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> And then reserve a half a cup of this mixture to make your dressing later. <time_token_26> <time_token_28> The rest of it you want to pour over three skinless, boneless chicken breasts about six <time_token_28> <time_token_28> to eight ounces each. <time_token_29> <time_token_31> Seal it up, refrigerate it if you're going to marinate this longer than 15 minutes but <time_token_31> <time_token_32> if you wanted to do it for as little as 15 you totally could. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> For the croutons today I'm using a multigrain bread. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> It's a little unorthodox I guess but it's a little bit healthier. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> You certainly could use regular bread if you wanted to. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> Like a chewy rustic bread would work as well. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Brush two slices of multigrain bread with olive oil. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> Have your broiler preheating. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> These croutons are going to be broiled. <time_token_39> <time_token_39> A little bit of salt. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> And then just broil them until they're golden brown and then you'll cut them up afterwards. <time_token_41> <time_token_43> When you're ready to make your salad, take your chicken out of the marinade letting the <time_token_43> <time_token_44> excess drip back into the bag and then place it on a rimmed baking sheet that's been lined <time_token_44> <time_token_46> So let the excess liquid drip off but some of it's going to end up on the pan and that <time_token_46> <time_token_47> will get a little extra caramelized slash burnt in the oven which is why you want to <time_token_47> <time_token_48> put it on this rimmed baking sheet with the foil. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Have your broiler preheating and then cook it until your chicken is cooked through. <time_token_49> <time_token_50> It should take about 13 to 15 minutes. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> While you're waiting you can make your dressing. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> This is a quarter cup of light mayonnaise. <time_token_52> <time_token_53> You can use regular mayonnaise if you want to. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> To that add your reserved buttermilk marinade. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> That's why there was the cheese in there. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Caesar salad always has cheese, delicious. <time_token_56> <time_token_58> We're not using all that much but you can feel free to add more if you want to. <time_token_58> <time_token_59> Caesar salad always has romaine. <time_token_59> <time_token_60> Today I'm combining my romaine lettuce with some radicchio though for a little bit of <time_token_60> <time_token_62> Two heads of romaine cut into pieces and a half a head. <time_token_62> <time_token_63> Radicchio that's also been shredded. <time_token_64> <time_token_65> You can toss everything together in the bowl that you made your dressing. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> I told you it wasn't a conventional Caesar salad. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> I wasn't kidding. <time_token_68> <time_token_70> It's sort of a cross between Caesar salad and a ranch. <time_token_70> <time_token_71> The buttermilk instead of the mayonnaise base. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> Set that aside for a sec. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> Cut up your chicken. <time_token_72> <time_token_74> Gotten just a little bit of golden brown and those extra brown spots are broiled cheese <time_token_74> <time_token_74> which adds extra deliciousness. <time_token_74> <time_token_76> These are cooked just until they're cooked through so the chicken isn't dry. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Chicken can go into the salad with your radicchio. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Chicken goes in. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> You want to toss everything together. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I find that tossing my salads with the dressings makes for a much better eating experience <time_token_79> <time_token_80> than drizzling over the top. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> One last thing. <time_token_81> <time_token_82> Cut the bread into whatever size croutons you like. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> Say I don't know about an inch. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Toss your croutons into your salad. <time_token_84> <time_token_85> Very hearty, fantastic. <time_token_86> <time_token_86> Serve it up in a nice big bowl. <time_token_87> <time_token_90> It's a heartier, kind of healthier, kind of lighter version of chicken Caesar salad that <time_token_90> <time_token_91> I'm sure everybody is going to love. <time_token_93> <time_token_93> Thanks for watching this video.

This is <time_token_13> <time_token_14> going to make a large pan of macaroni and cheese so it's for more than two or <time_token_14> <time_token_15> three people it's kind of like for one of those affairs you go to and you have <time_token_15> <time_token_15> to take a dish so just stay tuned okay <time_token_16> <time_token_20> okay so now I have the macaroni that's already been drained and I'm going to <time_token_20> <time_token_22> put in three tablespoons of butter I'm going to stir the butter in you can use <time_token_22> <time_token_23> margarine you can use some country crock whichever you know is your favorite <time_token_23> <time_token_24> you can most certainly use that so I'm just stirring this in and it's going to <time_token_24> <time_token_27> melt because the macaroni is still hot and now I'm going to take a jar of <time_token_27> <time_token_28> cheese whiz and I'm going to put this in and this is going to melt as well <time_token_28> <time_token_30> because the macaroni like I said is still hot and this recipe it might be <time_token_30> <time_token_31> too much cheese for you but this is the way my son's like it so this is kind of <time_token_31> <time_token_33> the only way that I make it so I'm just stirring in that cheese whiz so mixing <time_token_33> <time_token_34> this is going to take me a minute so I'm going to mix it all together and I'll <time_token_34> <time_token_36> be right back and show you the rest of the process okay so the cheese is all <time_token_36> <time_token_37> the cheese whiz is all incorporated so now I'm going to take the regular milk <time_token_37> <time_token_41> and I'm going to pour this in and stir this in as well and now we're just going <time_token_41> <time_token_43> to assemble our macaroni and cheese so I have two cups of mild cheddar and I <time_token_43> <time_token_44> have four cups of sharp cheddar the reason that I use it and with you know <time_token_44> <time_token_45> like that is because there's already mild cheese in it so you want to give it <time_token_45> <time_token_46> just a little bit of a bite with the sharp cheese so this is how they layer <time_token_48> <time_token_50> it going to force the macaroni in spread it around a little bit and I'm <time_token_50> <time_token_52> going to sprinkle in some of the mild cheese this is a really cheesy recipe <time_token_53> <time_token_54> this way they'll be cheese throughout and I'm going to take quite a bit of the <time_token_54> <time_token_57> sharp and layer that on top as well spread that around and add some more of <time_token_57> <time_token_60> the macaroni and it's just the same process spread the macaroni around and <time_token_60> <time_token_60> then we're going to use more cheese <time_token_63> <time_token_64> and you just keep layering until you're all finished <time_token_66> <time_token_68> like actually more cheese than macaroni in their macaroni and cheese and then <time_token_68> <time_token_69> I'm just going to put the rest of the macaroni right on the top and you might <time_token_69> <time_token_70> have to mash it down a little bit because it is going to be a full pan and <time_token_70> <time_token_71> make sure when you put it in the oven that you put it on maybe a cookie sheet <time_token_71> <time_token_72> so that way if there's any drips or anything you won't have to worry about <time_token_72> <time_token_72> having to clean your stove once you're done <time_token_75> <time_token_78> and I'm going to put this aside and now we're going to add the rest of the cheese <time_token_78> <time_token_80> right on top this way little bakes will have a nice crust on the top from the cheese <time_token_82> <time_token_83> so what I'm going to do is put this in the oven on 350 to 375 for approximately <time_token_83> <time_token_84> 45 minutes with the foil on after the 45 minutes are up I'm going to take the <time_token_84> <time_token_85> foil off and just let it cook on the top so that it gets a nice even browning <time_token_85> <time_token_87> on the top and you can even to put it like right under your broiler but watch <time_token_87> <time_token_87> that closely because the broiler has a tendency to work really fast and it will <time_token_87> <time_token_88> burn your food if you have you're not watching closely so I'm going to drop <time_token_88> <time_token_89> this in the oven and I'll be back to show you the end result <time_token_92> <time_token_93> okay and here we have dinner all done we have the red beans and rice we have <time_token_93> <time_token_94> some collard greens here the macaroni and cheese and some baked chicken so I'm <time_token_94> <time_token_95> really hoping you enjoy

400................................................", "asr_text": "<time_token_0> <time_token_0> Oh! Guten Tag! And thank you for joining us again for cooking with us. <time_token_0> <time_token_2> As you may or may not know, my husband and I just got back from a trip to Europe, and the last place we stayed was Munich, Germany. <time_token_2> <time_token_2> So today we're going to make German potato salad and Wiener schnitzel. <time_token_2> <time_token_4> And Wiener schnitzel actually means, well, the schnitzel part just means it's a breaded, usually veal, cutlet that's fried. <time_token_4> <time_token_4> But the Wiener part means that it's actually from Vienna. <time_token_4> <time_token_5> We also went to Vienna, so it kind of works out. <time_token_5> <time_token_6> And my husband, this one, actually ate a lot of Wiener schnitzel while we were in Munich. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> It was good. <time_token_6> <time_token_6> That's why we're going to make that today. <time_token_7> <time_token_8> German-style potato salad is very different from most potato salads that we've had in the United States. <time_token_8> <time_token_8> And that involves boiling Yukon gold potatoes. <time_token_8> <time_token_9> So we're going to first start with bacon. <time_token_9> <time_token_9> Can't hurt, I really love bacon. <time_token_9> <time_token_10> You know, the potatoes have to be boiled for three minutes, so let's start that. <time_token_10> <time_token_10> How many potatoes? <time_token_10> <time_token_10> Hot for house. <time_token_11> <time_token_11> We're boiling our potatoes for 20 to 30 minutes since we're using our pressure cooker. <time_token_11> <time_token_12> Hope it'll be a little bit less. <time_token_12> <time_token_12> We can't really find pretty red onions here, but we got one. <time_token_12> <time_token_12> Chopping the red onion now. <time_token_13> <time_token_13> Let me chop. <time_token_13> <time_token_14> We only need one tablespoon of dill. <time_token_14> <time_token_14> Now we're going to chop our dill into tiny pieces. <time_token_14> <time_token_15> Tiny, tiny, yeah, tiny pieces. <time_token_15> <time_token_16> So we're adding one teaspoon of sugar to what will be our mixture of our potatoes. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> Two teaspoons of salt. <time_token_16> <time_token_16> And then it says one fresh cracked pepper. <time_token_17> <time_token_17> Three quarters of a cup red wine vinegar. <time_token_18> <time_token_18> Three quarter cup vegetable oil. <time_token_19> <time_token_19> One quarter cup chicken stock. <time_token_19> <time_token_20> You almost look like a gelatin. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> I've never reserved bacon. <time_token_20> <time_token_20> I've never reserved that before. <time_token_20> <time_token_21> Okay, we're going to just do two teaspoons of the bacon fat. <time_token_21> <time_token_22> These are really hot potatoes. <time_token_22> <time_token_22> We're going to let them cool for a little bit before you remove the skins. <time_token_22> <time_token_23> You hold it like this, and the skin just peels off. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> And that's why you save your hand from being burned. <time_token_23> <time_token_23> Look how hot that is. <time_token_23> <time_token_24> You can see the seam. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> So yeah, I'm just using this part of the towel to take off the skin. <time_token_24> <time_token_24> It's coming off really easily. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> It's really cool looking. <time_token_25> <time_token_25> So we've removed the skins from our potatoes. <time_token_25> <time_token_26> In the meantime, they're just going to crush up our bacon. <time_token_27> <time_token_27> Cut it into thin slices and then into even smaller slices. <time_token_27> <time_token_28> It goes in the bowl? <time_token_28> <time_token_28> Now gently mix it. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> Because they're very... <time_token_29> <time_token_29> They can easily turn into motion. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> We don't want that. <time_token_29> <time_token_29> This looks good. <time_token_30> <time_token_30> I'll add some of the bacon now for that. <time_token_30> <time_token_31> So this looks really a lot more liquidy than what the recipe shows. <time_token_31> <time_token_31> Looks good though. <time_token_31> <time_token_32> So we are waiting on our potato salad to just rest. <time_token_32> <time_token_33> To me it's a little too bit of a degree, but there instead it tastes authentic from when <time_token_33> <time_token_33> we were in Germany. <time_token_33> <time_token_33> So I guess I didn't eat it then, so I believe him. <time_token_33> <time_token_34> And now we're going to start with our beanish tinsel. <time_token_34> <time_token_35> Flour first, then the egg mixture, and then the breadcrumbs finally, and then they're <time_token_35> <time_token_35> going to rest onto this plate we're working on. <time_token_35> <time_token_36> I've never used breadcrumbs in my life before. <time_token_36> <time_token_36> So a lot of people say I use two eggs. <time_token_36> <time_token_37> Some say three, since it's a large pot I'm going to use three. <time_token_37> <time_token_38> And finally the flour. <time_token_38> <time_token_38> We tried to get the kale cut. <time_token_38> <time_token_39> It's going to be super authentic to the Viennese meaner tinsel. <time_token_39> <time_token_40> But the only real cutlets we could find at the major meat market here were frozen. <time_token_40> <time_token_40> So these are tenderized pork chops, so we don't have to beat them. <time_token_40> <time_token_41> Then they're pretty thin. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> So that works out for us because we don't have a meat mallet. <time_token_41> <time_token_41> First you dredge it in the flour. <time_token_42> <time_token_42> Shake the flour off. <time_token_43> <time_token_43> Put it in the eggs. <time_token_44> <time_token_44> Put the eggs drip off. <time_token_44> <time_token_45> Put it in the breadcrumbs. <time_token_45> <time_token_45> Don't push the breadcrumbs into it. <time_token_45> <time_token_46> The breadcrumbs are just going to make a layer on the outside. <time_token_46> <time_token_46> So it doesn't lightly not hurt it. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> Put it in the breadcrumbs. <time_token_47> <time_token_47> You did really good with that. <time_token_47> <time_token_48> Guess that's good enough. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> I mean I guess. <time_token_48> <time_token_48> And then let it sit. <time_token_48> <time_token_49> Let it sit till it dries out a little bit. <time_token_50> <time_token_50> If you're looking for lard in a store, it's the package that says lard on it. <time_token_50> <time_token_51> It's what's for dinner. <time_token_51> <time_token_52> Okay, so this is the first time I've ever seen lard in person or held it in my hands. <time_token_52> <time_token_52> How much lard? <time_token_52> <time_token_53> I said it has to go to the size of your front hand a quarter inch. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> So enough of that. <time_token_53> <time_token_53> Enough to do that. <time_token_53> <time_token_54> That is my iron skirt. <time_token_54> <time_token_54> That is my lard. <time_token_54> <time_token_55> So the first thing we do is get the lard melted obviously. <time_token_55> <time_token_55> The temperature of the lard is to be 330 degrees. <time_token_55> <time_token_56> Before you even tread for these guys then. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> Because what you want to do is put them in. <time_token_56> <time_token_56> Cook them for three to five minutes on one side. <time_token_57> <time_token_57> And when you flip them, you're going to start putting the oil of the lard on top. <time_token_57> <time_token_58> Because that's going to keep it crispy. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> And then we put it in our oven which is at 200 degrees right now. <time_token_58> <time_token_58> It's been waiting. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> Oh good boy. <time_token_59> <time_token_59> He is a spoiled dog. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> He is a pretty bear. <time_token_60> <time_token_60> That is a lot of lard. <time_token_60> <time_token_61> The amount of lard that you put in to fry it with is independent of the amount of lard <time_token_61> <time_token_62> that stays on the VMS in the side. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> Maybe this is going to be the best dinner you've ever eaten. <time_token_62> <time_token_62> So, we will take the temperature. <time_token_63> <time_token_64> Okay, so now we're going to do the dangerous task of putting our Venerage Missiles into <time_token_64> <time_token_64> a very hot lard. <time_token_64> <time_token_64> Which is not going to be pleasant. <time_token_65> <time_token_65> It was a Venerage Missiles. <time_token_65> <time_token_66> Well please be careful. <time_token_66> <time_token_66> We need three minutes. <time_token_66> <time_token_67> You're doing very good. <time_token_67> <time_token_67> It feels very crunchy in the bottom. <time_token_67> <time_token_68> Everything in red says don't flip more than once. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> Only flip one time. <time_token_68> <time_token_68> So, we won't be flipping it. <time_token_68> <time_token_69> We'll just be hoping that it is great. <time_token_70> <time_token_70> There you go. <time_token_71> <time_token_71> Still a mince. <time_token_71> <time_token_72> While we wait for the Venerage Missiles. <time_token_72> <time_token_72> They don't have some lids because they don't talk. <time_token_72> <time_token_73> And also you squeeze some of the juice on top of the Venerage Missiles. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> And that's really the way you're supposed to eat it. <time_token_73> <time_token_73> You guys are good? <time_token_74> <time_token_74> Yeah, I'm going to do that. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> It looks really good. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> So I'm going to eat it. <time_token_75> <time_token_75> Let it go. <time_token_76> <time_token_76> This Venerage Missiles is bomb. <time_token_76> <time_token_77> Hi, it's the next morning. <time_token_77> <time_token_77> Last night we enjoyed very much our Venerage Missiles and our potato salad. <time_token_77> <time_token_78> Especially let the potato salad sit on your plate for a little while. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> It doesn't seem as vinegary at all. <time_token_78> <time_token_78> It's actually quite good. <time_token_78> <time_token_79> I'm going to share this one with my husband for breakfast. <time_token_79> <time_token_79> Even though we had two last night and we only had one. <time_token_79> <time_token_80> We should have obviously made out more than four. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> But now we know how to make them and they're easy. <time_token_80> <time_token_80> I just made coffee. <time_token_80> <time_token_81> As you can see, I'm being legit a full wife. <time_token_81> <time_token_81> That was big, isn't it? <time_token_81> <time_token_81> So that makes it breakfast, right? <time_token_82> <time_token_82> Should put some lemon juice on. <time_token_82> <time_token_83> But to give a solid finish to the video, which I don't think I did last night. <time_token_83> <time_token_84> Obviously it's best to eat the Venerage Missiles right away because it's very crunchy and good. <time_token_85> <time_token_86> So, as you can kind of see, this is our plate of leftover Venerage Missiles and potato salad. <time_token_86> <time_token_87> I put some lemon juice on, as you saw. <time_token_87> <time_token_87> And not for a smaller bite. <time_token_88> <time_token_88> So, whenever apparently I take a bite of something that tastes good, I go like this. <time_token_88> <time_token_89> Have you noticed that? <time_token_89> <time_token_89> I've noticed it watching my own videos. <time_token_89> <time_token_89> So, the Venerage Missiles is freaking good. <time_token_89> <time_token_90> Super easy to make. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> And you should definitely try it. <time_token_90> <time_token_90> This to me tastes like Germany because that's where you eat most of it. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> But obviously it should also taste like Vienna. <time_token_91> <time_token_91> Or anywhere in Austria, I guess. <time_token_91> <time_token_92> The potato salad is singularly delicious. <time_token_92> <time_token_92> Well, there you have it everybody. <time_token_92> <time_token_93> This port version of Venerable has an A plus thumbs up from me. <time_token_93> <time_token_94> And it didn't have one from there as well. <time_token_94> <time_token_94> He's going to come down to eat it for breakfast. <time_token_94> <time_token_95> And good to not petite. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> Thanks for joining us. <time_token_95> <time_token_95> Das ist mein, kitty cat. <time_token_95> <time_token_96> Das ist mein. <time_token_96> <time_token_96> Frau line, kitty cat. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> Yeah, you got to follow me. <time_token_97> <time_token_97> What's your dog?
